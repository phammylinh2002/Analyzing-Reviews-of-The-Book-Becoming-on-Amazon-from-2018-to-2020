    "\n",
    "This small project aims to help me get back on track with data analytics while evaluating whether **Becoming** by **Michelle Obama** is worth reading. I’ve come across this book in many bookstores and have heard positive reviews, but I’m still unsure if it’s suitable for me at this time. By analyzing readers' reviews, we can gain insights into what people think about the book and decide whether to purchase it now or at a later stage in my life.\n",

    "- **`asin`**: This column is the opposite of the previous column. While the previous column contains 5000 unique values equaling to the number of rows of the dataset, this column contains only 1 value throughout the dataset. The data it holds is just a number which looks like a unique identifier. However, if the value is repeated, it is no longer a unique identifier. And as I do not need a unique identifier for this dataset, this column will be removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`product name`**: Just like the previous column, this one only contains 1 value. And since the product whose reviews I analyze is just 1, there is no need for this column as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ratings`**: The number of unique values in this column is perfectly correct as there are 5 levels equivalent to 5 stars to rate a book. This one will stay. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`reviews`**: Aha! This is the main character of this analysis. 4993 unique values out of 5000 values is not bad. To be honest, I expect it to be 5000 unique values in this column as no review should be the same as any other one. Definitely I will keep this one but I will inspect its duplicate values later.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`helpful`**: This is the number of \"helpful\" votes other reviewers voted on a review. The number of unique values is okay, in my opinion. I will keep this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`date`**: The uniqueness of the values in this column is okay too. This one will stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Unnamed: 6`**: Uh oh, this one is not good as it has 0 unique values. Look at some of its data above, its values are just NaN. Definitely delete it!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`target`**: Though the uniqueness of the values in this column is okay, I don't see if it is any helpful. And I can't find the metadata for this specific dataset. So that it will go away.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`text`**: It is easy to notice from the first 5 rows of the data printed above that the column **`reviews`** and this column are the same. Definitely this column will be removed. "
