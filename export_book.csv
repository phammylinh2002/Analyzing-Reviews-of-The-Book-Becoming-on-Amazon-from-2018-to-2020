  I believe I always loved Michelle Obama.  Her grace and dignity always seemed to come as a gift from above.  Her spirit is so incredibly deep and strong.  The stories from her childhood, her brother, her neighborhood, her family, inform us in a brilliant voice about what it was like in the place and time she grew up.Michelle Obama has the empathy and the depth of character so missing in her media portrayal.  I always felt worried that we were suffocating her.  But there is a Michelle Obama who is bigger than the words on a page.  She knows our pains, and she understands our lives.  And we know her in this book.  In this most private book, we know her in a way we could not have otherwise.  Interesting that nothing here surprises me, it only affirms what I felt like I know:  Michelle Obama is a person like us.  She worked and suffered and overcame.Her storytelling skills are exquisite. It left me a little breathless to hear her voice, unfettered and real.I love the photographs.

  The rating is strictly for the production of the book and not the content. I decided to purchase a couple of copies for my Mother and I. I have the book on audible and wanted a hard copy to write notes in. In the picture you’ll notice that there is a hint of ink on a number of the pages. I took a picture of the following pages for comparison. You can’t read them at all or some pages are so faint that if you hold a bright light, like the flash of my camera, you can see the print. I’m obviously returning these copies and hoping the replacements don’t turn out the same.

  I started reading and couldn't put it down, finishing it literally 24 hrs after delivery.  Michelle Robinson Obama's story is one of challenges met, hard work tempered with good sense, and above all, how a few key people in a life can support a young girl and elevate her, so that she, in turn, can elevate others.  It is a wonderful, heartfelt, true story of HOPE in a world gone far too cynical.

  I've always been an Independent Voter. I have no bias against Michelle Obama, or negativism to say about her role as First Lady.  However, I found her book to be grossly arrogant in its content and attempts at self-promotion...the very opposite portrayal of her wish to identify with, ""us ordinary women,"" that she tries so hard to convey to her readers. Her latest appearance and comments on, The Jimmy Fallon Show, about sending the current First Lady a, ""Bye Felicia wish,"" was very telling about her lack of truthfulness in her book about always choosing, ""to go high,"" when she communicates messages to other disagreeing Americans. It was a rude and undignified comment, and I was embarrassed for her. She slipped at that very moment, and the world saw the truth behind the curtain of what type of woman she truthfully is in reality. She owes the current First Lady an apology.  I will not recommend this book, because of its untruthful representation.

  This a book that is difficult to resist, the writing is sublime. Michelle Obama has a way with words, this is one of the most fascinating and informative books I have read this yearThere is a great deal to admire about Michelle Obama. A young woman brought up on the other side of the tracks in Chicago, went to Princeton and then Harvard for her law degree, and became the First Lady Of The United States. Some of her success was due to luck, but most is due to her intelligence and her hard work. As a woman and a black woman, she had to work three times as hard as a man, and she proved her worth.Michelle Obama tells us she is writing this book to inspire the next generation. She knows how important role models are, especially for young women of color in a culture that isn’t changing fast enough. She says in her book , ‘Here I am, I have got a lot to say.’ Her book is divided into three sections-:’Becoming Me,” “Becoming Us”, and “Becoming More”.  What we find in these pages is a woman opening herself and her world to us. This is a book so well written, with such honesty and integrity, I felt like I was trusted with her secrets.She starts by talking about her upbringing, her life in Chicago, a family who showed such love and at the same time showed her that using her intellect to move herself forward was the right path. Off to Princeton where she was a minority for the first time, learning to navigate in a white world. Then to Harvard to study law, and her first job, where she met her future husband, Barack Obama.Then the life of a married woman, working full time, wanting a family and finally succeeding via InVitroFertilization. Her husband was into politics and was often not home, so Michelle was the parent. Some resentment, and couples therapy helped them through their rough spots. Political life is difficult and the statements by some were hurtful, and she names names. The scrutiny and constraints were a lesson she quickly learned, and went onto become one of the most beloved First Ladies.Now, Michelle Obama, has her real life back, and she is discovering who she wants to be. Malia and Sasha are settling into their lives with plans of their own. Michelle Obama has no love for politics, and she will never seek a political office. Michelle, Barack and the girls are llooking toward to the future.Michelle Obama is telling the truth of her life, she grew up surrounded by love in a city, Chicago, she loves, onward to an education that took her far. She has everything she wanted, family, a husband she loves, and now she is looking at her next adventure.  An autobiography I urge everyone to read. This is a book of the year.

  Just to be up front, I voted for Barack in both 2008 and 2012, I’m male, not white, a naturally born citizen who generally vote Democrat. Since this book was written by a somewhat polarizing person I thought being upfront on who I am made sense in todays world of identity politics. Also, I borrowed my friends EPUB and read it on his computer which is why it doesn’t say “verified purchaser” next to my name and the references I have below is from that EPUB. Oh, obviously I wanted to review the english version of this book but Amazon won't let me review it for some weird reason so I had to review this one.I generally respect Michelle Obama and her accomplishments but there are a few things that bother me about her and this book.One, I got the vibe that she has some resentment towards white people, particularly white men. Sometimes she brings up race in a context that makes sense like when she is talking about how one issue effects black people more than white people or talking about history. Other times she’ll mention someone is white for no reason at all. Here are a few examples:- Pg.1, paragraph 7.2 of the preface “working-class black student in a fancy mostly white college”- Pg. 17, chapter 2 “I liked my teacher, a diminutive white lady”. Why does her being white matter?- Pg. 20, chapter 2, “My friends included a girl named Rachel, whose mother was white and had a British accent”. Why did she only describe that friend with a white mother and not the race of the rest?- Pg.44, chapter 4, “Mr. Martinez and then Mr. Bennet, both gentle and good-humored African American men.” Ok, did it matter that were black in this context?- Pg. 71, “mostly white students” Context? History? Why did this matter?- Pg. 74, “one of the few nonwhite”- Pg. 74, “my two white roommates in Pyne Hall were both perfectly nice…” Again, who cares if they were white?- Pg. 75, “Cznery was a smart and beautiful black woman”. Why not just say beautiful? Why does black matter? It didn’t matter in her description in any historic or meaningful way.- Pg. 120, “Now that I was at Sidley and on the other side of the recruiting experience, my goal was to bring in law students who were not just smart and hard-driving but also something other than male and white.” I get it, you want to make the place more diverse. Sure. But the way she said “other than make and white” got a lot under my skin (remember I’m not white).- Pg. 148, “He was a black, brainy superhero. He clashed regularly and fearlessly with the mostly white old-guard members of the city council and was viewed as something of a walking legend” Ok, those white people again.- Pg. 148, “In a move many African Americans saw as a swift and demoralizing return to the old white ways of Chicago politics, voters went on to elect Richard M. Daley, the son of a previous mayor, Richard J. Daley, who was broadly considered the godfather of Chicago’s famous cronyism.” The old white guard? You mean just corrupt politicians right?- Pg. 205, “Our counselor—Dr.Woodchurch, let’s call him—was a soft-spoken white man who’d gone to good school and always wore khakis”. Michelle, what the hell? Who cares if your counselor was white.- Pg. 208, “The nervousness of white people”. Sigh.- Pg. 218, “Its whiteness and maleness”. …Sigh.I get it. She was in the minority most of the time being black and a woman and when she puts things into historical or social context it makes sense pointing these things out as it represents systematic problems in our society when it comes to race. But other times she brings up race for no real reason. Never in her book did she directly talk about an incident where she was the direct receipt of discrimination that I read. In a lot of ways she seemed pretty lucky to not be a victim of some kind of racism in her life. If she did, she never really talked about it in her book so I’m wondering why she brings up race needlessly. Especially in a somewhat resentful way. Technically she is a baby boomer so perhaps she is a product of her time? I’m not black and I was born in the 80’s and not the 60’s so perhaps I never had to see the things she saw. Still, I don’t like her subtle resentment towards white people. I hope I’m wrong about her when it comes to this.Two, Michelle paints Barack as a super hero. I'm not joking. Every way she describes is literally perfect from being easy going and brainy, to being a huge reader, to memorizing everything to never being angry or upset or taking things seriously. I get it. Barack is cool, smart and an overall good guy. But come on, he must have some flaw (outside him smoking). Something that he did wrong, something that he truly messed up. The only thing I remember her saying about him was that he wasn't always on time and one time he blew a book deal (or missed the deadline or something) because he was busy with something else. I'm pretty sure Michelle and her husband agreed to paint him in the most perfect light ever to protect his presidency which makes me think she is being dishonest about her experience with him. Did Barack have a hand in writing this? Was Michelle censored in a way? Here are some examples of Michelle describing Barack as nothing less than perfect:- Pg. 96. “What struck me was how assured he seemed of his own direction in life. He was oddly free from doubt,”- “Instead lived like a sixteenth century mountain hermit, reading lofty works of literature and philosophy” pg. 97- “Barack was serious without being self-serious. He was breezy in his manner but powerful in his mind. It was a strange, stirring combination.” Pg. 97- “I found myself admiring Barack for both his self-assuredness and his earnest demeanor. He was refreshing, unconventional, and weirdly elegant.” Pg. 97- “Barack bore no resemblance to the typical eager-beaver summer associate (as I myself had been two years earlier at Sidley), networking furiously and anxiously wondering whether a golden-ticket job offer was coming. He sauntered around with calm detachment, which seemed only to increase his appeal.” Pg. 99- “There was no arguing with the fact that even with his challenged sense of style, Barack was a catch. He was good-looking, poised, and successful. He was athletic, interesting, and kind.” Pg.99- “He was modest and lived modestly, yet knew the richness of his own mind and the world of privilege that would open up to him as a result. He took it all seriously, I could tell. He could be lighthearted and jokey, but he never strayed far from a larger sense of obligation. He was on some sort of quest, though he didn’t yet know where it would lead.” Pg. 101- “Barack had a smile that seemed to stretch the whole width of his face. He was a deadly combination of smooth and reasonable.” Pg. 103- “He had an easy rapport with everyone at the firm. He addressed all the secretaries by name and got along with everyone—from the older, stuffier lawyers to the ambitious young bucks who were now playing basketball. He’s a good person, I thought to myself, watching him pass the ball to another lawyer.” Pg. 105- “Having sat through scores of high school and college games, I recognized a good player when I saw one, and Barack quickly passed the test. He played an athletic, artful form of basketball, his lanky body moving quickly, showing power I hadn’t before noticed. He was swift and graceful, even in his Hawaiian footwear. I stood there pretending to listen to what somebody’s perfectly nice wife was saying to me, but my eyes stayed fixed on Barack. I was struck for the first time by the spectacle of him—this strange mix-of-everything man.” Pg. 105- “Barack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I’d dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good. To me, he was sort of like a unicorn—unusual to the point of seeming almost unreal. He never talked about material things, like buying a house or a car or even new shoes. His money went largely toward books, which to him were like sacred objects, providing ballast for his mind. He read late into the night, often long after I’d fallen asleep, plowing through history and biographies and Toni Morrison, too. He read several newspapers daily, cover to cover. He kept tabs on the latest book reviews, the American League standings, and what the South Side aldermen were up to. He could speak with equal passion about the Polish elections and which movies Roger Ebert had panned and why”. Pg. 111- “This, I was learning, was how Barack’s mind worked. He got himself fixated on big and abstract issues, fueled by some crazy sense that he might be able to do something about them. It was new to me, I have to say. Until now, I’d hung around with good people who cared about important enough things but who were focused primarily on building their careers and providing for their families. Barack was just different. He was dialed into the day-to-day demands of his life, but at the same time, especially at night, his thoughts seemed to roam a much wider plane.” Pg. 112- “I was gripped all over again by a sense of how special he was.” Pg.117- “And now in Hawaii, I could see his character reflected in other small ways. His long-lasting friendships with his high school buddies showed his consistency in relationships. In his devotion to his strong-willed mother, I saw a deep respect for women and their independence. Without needing to discuss it outright, I knew he could handle a partner who had her own passions and voice.” Pg. 123- “All this inborn confidence was admirable, of course, but honestly, try living with it. For me, coexisting with Barack’s strong sense of purpose—sleeping in the same bed with it, sitting at the breakfast table with it—was something to which I had to adjust, not because he flaunted it, exactly, but because it was so alive. In the presence of his certainty, his notion that he could make some sort of difference in the world, I couldn’t help but feel a little bit lost by comparison. His sense of purpose seemed like an unwitting challenge to my own.” Pg.131- For better or worse, I’d fallen in love with a man with a vision who was optimistic without being naive, undaunted by conflict, and intrigued by how complicated the world was. He was strangely unintimidated by how much work there was to be done. He was dreading the thought of leaving me and the girls for long stretches, he said, but he also kept reminding me of how secure our love was. “We can handle this, right?” he said, holding my hand one night as we sat in his upstairs study and finally began to really talk about it. “We’re strong and we’re smart, and so are our kids. We’ll be just fine. We can afford this.” Pg.224I’ll stop quoting the book at this point. There are other examples on pages 115, 123, 152, 153, 180, 184, 192, 261, 265, and 322. There are probably others that I missed. Why does this annoy me you may ask? Because it sounds made up. Insincere. As if I was reading his resume or something his press secretary came up with. Is Barack even human or does he just possess every positive characteristic known to mankind with none of the baggage? Don’t get me wrong, I liked him from the get go since 2004 and his background is impressive (president of the Harvard Law Review specifically). But the way Michelle describes him just seems so made up and one-sided it makes me question the rest of the book.Here are some highlights about Michelle that I learned from the book (for whoever is interested):- She told people she wanted to become a pediatrician when she was a kid because she loved being around kids and it was a pleasing answer to adults. She describes this later as always doing the correct thing.- Her dad had MS (Multiple Sclerosis), a progressive disease that made him disabled and eventually killed him at 55. This hurt Michelle more than anything else to see her dad disabled and defeated.- She had a very tight family and talked about anything, including her first period at the dinner table. Her brother was smart, cool and protective of her and she looked up to him. Her mom is an overwhelmingly positive force in her life.- She smoked some pot in high school and was friends with Jessie Jacksons daughter.- She failed the bar exam the first time around- She very much dislikes politics- She had a minor amount of marriage counseling with Barack, nothing serious though from what I could tell.- She had problems bearing children and had to use intro vivo fertilization with Malia but not Sasha.- Her kids are her top priority in life, especially when she was in the white house- She tries to remain hopeful and never cynical though I don’t know if she is always successful.- She graduated from Princeton then Harvard Law and started her career as a high powered lawyer however she never felt fulfillment from her job as a lawyer despite the money.Michelle is a hardworking lady (somewhat of an overachiever) with a tight schedule that she sticks too. I remember her mentioning she got up at 5am, worked out, took her kids to school then went to work then picked them up from school (this was before she first lady). Her academic background is very impressive as she graduated from Princeton and Harvard Law. I found her mothers reaction to her not being fulfilled by her work as lawyer despite the money and prestige hilarious. It is almost something a millennial would say, not a baby boomer. First world problems! Growing up lower-middle class, her mother was annoyed. But, you can’t really blame Michelle either. Her work did sound boring and unfulfilling. She wasn’t making the positive impact she wanted too.Michelle is deeply committed to her children. I’d argue that Malia and Sasha are the most important things to her and is her top priority, especially while she was first lady. She talked about them often in her book. Motherhood suites her well. If I were to describes Michelle’s life in one word is would be “busy” and one word to describe Michelle herself would be “workaholic”. She is obviously a likable person and likes many people in return.Bottom Line:To be blunt, I'm not sure why this book is getting 91% 5 stars. I just finished the book and I can't say I was particularly blown away like the ratings suggest. Michelle simply talked about her life, meeting Barack and her perspective of life in the white house which sounded boring from the way she describes it. She met many heads of states, worked hard spreading her message about good nutrition and empowering women but again, nothing interesting or fun. Towards the end of the book I was pretty much skimming through the words since I lost interest in what she was saying. I probably went 20 pages before I realized it and had to go back and reread. I got some insight to who Michelle was but in the end of the day I just thought to myself ""who cares?"". Shrug, I just didn't see anything particularly special or interesting about this book that would make me really recommend it to anyone. The only reason I even finished the book was simply to say “yeah, I read that book”.  I also didn't think this book was that inspirational as all the reviews keep saying.  There are millions of people around the world who come from nothing or near nothing and ""make it"" who have tougher backgrounds than Michelle (disabled people for example).  I don't see how her particular story is anything TRULY miraculous.  Good, sure.  Did she overcome?  Sure.  Did it blow my mind with inspiration?  No.That being said, it isn’t a bad book either. It was well written, easy to follow and very detailed orientated. She mentioned many people’s name that she met over her life and how they influenced her. She remembered specific places, when she went there, details about those places and her experience there. I would recommend this book to anyone who had a special fascination with Michelle or first ladies in general. The book is fine. 3 out of 5 stars.As a final note, I felt it was important that I wrote this review for two reasons. One, I depend on reviews to be fair, objective and honest. When I see a book get 500 reviews in 2 weeks with a near 92% of reviews being 5 stars on Amazon I knew something wasn’t right. 92% of people saying your book was 5 stars would mean this book should win the Pulitzer award. That means this book is amazing, a breakthrough, something that every person must read or they’ll miss out on a life experience. What if a truly amazing book is written one day? Something that is considered a classic? Something that blows the mind of society? What reviews does that book get? 99% instead of 95%? Seems crazy to me.Two, I wanted a review that judged more the book than the author. Michelle is a classy lady no doubt, but her book really isn’t that good. I didn’t want Amazon reviews to turn into a popularity contest where men rate this book highly, women another book, liberals another books, conservatives yet another book, democrats this book, republicans that book. Identity politics really annoys me. I hate that I had to preface this review with my “identity” but I had to otherwise I just would’ve been called an angry conservative republican white man. I think we should judge a book on the book alone and not the “identity” of the author. Of course considering the popularity of this author and the fact that this was a memoir it couldn’t be completely avoided. Hopefully my bias is at a minimum.So anyway like I said, book was fine. Not bad, not great. C+ or perhaps a B depending on how much you are interested in Mrs. Obama. Oh by the way this book has nothing to do with Trump. She rarely mentioned him or his politics outside the whole “grab them by the p****” remark Trump made a while back. So if anyone thinks this book is some attack on Trump or Republicans I can tell you it isn’t. Any review that says it is is obviously made up.

",313,13-Dec-18,,n,"

  Just to be up front, I voted for Barack in both 2008 and 2012, I’m male, not white, a naturally born citizen who generally vote Democrat. Since this book was written by a somewhat polarizing person I thought being upfront on who I am made sense in todays world of identity politics. Also, I borrowed my friends EPUB and read it on his computer which is why it doesn’t say “verified purchaser” next to my name and the references I have below is from that EPUB. Oh, obviously I wanted to review the english version of this book but Amazon won't let me review it for some weird reason so I had to review this one.I generally respect Michelle Obama and her accomplishments but there are a few things that bother me about her and this book.One, I got the vibe that she has some resentment towards white people, particularly white men. Sometimes she brings up race in a context that makes sense like when she is talking about how one issue effects black people more than white people or talking about history. Other times she’ll mention someone is white for no reason at all. Here are a few examples:- Pg.1, paragraph 7.2 of the preface “working-class black student in a fancy mostly white college”- Pg. 17, chapter 2 “I liked my teacher, a diminutive white lady”. Why does her being white matter?- Pg. 20, chapter 2, “My friends included a girl named Rachel, whose mother was white and had a British accent”. Why did she only describe that friend with a white mother and not the race of the rest?- Pg.44, chapter 4, “Mr. Martinez and then Mr. Bennet, both gentle and good-humored African American men.” Ok, did it matter that were black in this context?- Pg. 71, “mostly white students” Context? History? Why did this matter?- Pg. 74, “one of the few nonwhite”- Pg. 74, “my two white roommates in Pyne Hall were both perfectly nice…” Again, who cares if they were white?- Pg. 75, “Cznery was a smart and beautiful black woman”. Why not just say beautiful? Why does black matter? It didn’t matter in her description in any historic or meaningful way.- Pg. 120, “Now that I was at Sidley and on the other side of the recruiting experience, my goal was to bring in law students who were not just smart and hard-driving but also something other than male and white.” I get it, you want to make the place more diverse. Sure. But the way she said “other than make and white” got a lot under my skin (remember I’m not white).- Pg. 148, “He was a black, brainy superhero. He clashed regularly and fearlessly with the mostly white old-guard members of the city council and was viewed as something of a walking legend” Ok, those white people again.- Pg. 148, “In a move many African Americans saw as a swift and demoralizing return to the old white ways of Chicago politics, voters went on to elect Richard M. Daley, the son of a previous mayor, Richard J. Daley, who was broadly considered the godfather of Chicago’s famous cronyism.” The old white guard? You mean just corrupt politicians right?- Pg. 205, “Our counselor—Dr.Woodchurch, let’s call him—was a soft-spoken white man who’d gone to good school and always wore khakis”. Michelle, what the hell? Who cares if your counselor was white.- Pg. 208, “The nervousness of white people”. Sigh.- Pg. 218, “Its whiteness and maleness”. …Sigh.I get it. She was in the minority most of the time being black and a woman and when she puts things into historical or social context it makes sense pointing these things out as it represents systematic problems in our society when it comes to race. But other times she brings up race for no real reason. Never in her book did she directly talk about an incident where she was the direct receipt of discrimination that I read. In a lot of ways she seemed pretty lucky to not be a victim of some kind of racism in her life. If she did, she never really talked about it in her book so I’m wondering why she brings up race needlessly. Especially in a somewhat resentful way. Technically she is a baby boomer so perhaps she is a product of her time? I’m not black and I was born in the 80’s and not the 60’s so perhaps I never had to see the things she saw. Still, I don’t like her subtle resentment towards white people. I hope I’m wrong about her when it comes to this.Two, Michelle paints Barack as a super hero. I'm not joking. Every way she describes is literally perfect from being easy going and brainy, to being a huge reader, to memorizing everything to never being angry or upset or taking things seriously. I get it. Barack is cool, smart and an overall good guy. But come on, he must have some flaw (outside him smoking). Something that he did wrong, something that he truly messed up. The only thing I remember her saying about him was that he wasn't always on time and one time he blew a book deal (or missed the deadline or something) because he was busy with something else. I'm pretty sure Michelle and her husband agreed to paint him in the most perfect light ever to protect his presidency which makes me think she is being dishonest about her experience with him. Did Barack have a hand in writing this? Was Michelle censored in a way? Here are some examples of Michelle describing Barack as nothing less than perfect:- Pg. 96. “What struck me was how assured he seemed of his own direction in life. He was oddly free from doubt,”- “Instead lived like a sixteenth century mountain hermit, reading lofty works of literature and philosophy” pg. 97- “Barack was serious without being self-serious. He was breezy in his manner but powerful in his mind. It was a strange, stirring combination.” Pg. 97- “I found myself admiring Barack for both his self-assuredness and his earnest demeanor. He was refreshing, unconventional, and weirdly elegant.” Pg. 97- “Barack bore no resemblance to the typical eager-beaver summer associate (as I myself had been two years earlier at Sidley), networking furiously and anxiously wondering whether a golden-ticket job offer was coming. He sauntered around with calm detachment, which seemed only to increase his appeal.” Pg. 99- “There was no arguing with the fact that even with his challenged sense of style, Barack was a catch. He was good-looking, poised, and successful. He was athletic, interesting, and kind.” Pg.99- “He was modest and lived modestly, yet knew the richness of his own mind and the world of privilege that would open up to him as a result. He took it all seriously, I could tell. He could be lighthearted and jokey, but he never strayed far from a larger sense of obligation. He was on some sort of quest, though he didn’t yet know where it would lead.” Pg. 101- “Barack had a smile that seemed to stretch the whole width of his face. He was a deadly combination of smooth and reasonable.” Pg. 103- “He had an easy rapport with everyone at the firm. He addressed all the secretaries by name and got along with everyone—from the older, stuffier lawyers to the ambitious young bucks who were now playing basketball. He’s a good person, I thought to myself, watching him pass the ball to another lawyer.” Pg. 105- “Having sat through scores of high school and college games, I recognized a good player when I saw one, and Barack quickly passed the test. He played an athletic, artful form of basketball, his lanky body moving quickly, showing power I hadn’t before noticed. He was swift and graceful, even in his Hawaiian footwear. I stood there pretending to listen to what somebody’s perfectly nice wife was saying to me, but my eyes stayed fixed on Barack. I was struck for the first time by the spectacle of him—this strange mix-of-everything man.” Pg. 105- “Barack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I’d dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good. To me, he was sort of like a unicorn—unusual to the point of seeming almost unreal. He never talked about material things, like buying a house or a car or even new shoes. His money went largely toward books, which to him were like sacred objects, providing ballast for his mind. He read late into the night, often long after I’d fallen asleep, plowing through history and biographies and Toni Morrison, too. He read several newspapers daily, cover to cover. He kept tabs on the latest book reviews, the American League standings, and what the South Side aldermen were up to. He could speak with equal passion about the Polish elections and which movies Roger Ebert had panned and why”. Pg. 111- “This, I was learning, was how Barack’s mind worked. He got himself fixated on big and abstract issues, fueled by some crazy sense that he might be able to do something about them. It was new to me, I have to say. Until now, I’d hung around with good people who cared about important enough things but who were focused primarily on building their careers and providing for their families. Barack was just different. He was dialed into the day-to-day demands of his life, but at the same time, especially at night, his thoughts seemed to roam a much wider plane.” Pg. 112- “I was gripped all over again by a sense of how special he was.” Pg.117- “And now in Hawaii, I could see his character reflected in other small ways. His long-lasting friendships with his high school buddies showed his consistency in relationships. In his devotion to his strong-willed mother, I saw a deep respect for women and their independence. Without needing to discuss it outright, I knew he could handle a partner who had her own passions and voice.” Pg. 123- “All this inborn confidence was admirable, of course, but honestly, try living with it. For me, coexisting with Barack’s strong sense of purpose—sleeping in the same bed with it, sitting at the breakfast table with it—was something to which I had to adjust, not because he flaunted it, exactly, but because it was so alive. In the presence of his certainty, his notion that he could make some sort of difference in the world, I couldn’t help but feel a little bit lost by comparison. His sense of purpose seemed like an unwitting challenge to my own.” Pg.131- For better or worse, I’d fallen in love with a man with a vision who was optimistic without being naive, undaunted by conflict, and intrigued by how complicated the world was. He was strangely unintimidated by how much work there was to be done. He was dreading the thought of leaving me and the girls for long stretches, he said, but he also kept reminding me of how secure our love was. “We can handle this, right?” he said, holding my hand one night as we sat in his upstairs study and finally began to really talk about it. “We’re strong and we’re smart, and so are our kids. We’ll be just fine. We can afford this.” Pg.224I’ll stop quoting the book at this point. There are other examples on pages 115, 123, 152, 153, 180, 184, 192, 261, 265, and 322. There are probably others that I missed. Why does this annoy me you may ask? Because it sounds made up. Insincere. As if I was reading his resume or something his press secretary came up with. Is Barack even human or does he just possess every positive characteristic known to mankind with none of the baggage?

But the way Michelle describes him just seems so made up and one-sided it makes me question the rest of the book.Here are some highlights about Michelle that I learned from the book (for whoever is interested):- She told people she wanted to become a pediatrician when she was a kid because she loved being around kids and it was a pleasing answer to adults.

I picked this up at my  local library because it was displayed prominently there in front and I usually like to try new things. Not a very engaging read and very boring.

  The near rags to riches story of Michelle Obama is a gripping one worth reading. I didn't want to put it down. The Obamas spent 8 years in the White House without scandal or outrage. We may never see that again!She is an admirable woman and a fine role model. From a child living in government housing projects on the poor South Side of Chicago to Princeton to living in the White House, she proved herself to be a woman true to herself. Now she is one of the elites, but the book shows she doesn't forget her early days and she is filled with compassion and caring for others less fortunate. The book gives the feeling that if you knew her you would be friends because she is real and down to earth.The book succeeds in showing women they must find their voice and speak up and believe in themselves. I applaud her and the book. It brought tears to my eyes and deep appreciation for the Obamas. The book is not self-serving. It is honest and straight forward. Her brief comments on white racism also gave me a new understanding of what blacks have endured. Racism is shameful and I am now more aware of it.In the book Michelle asks the question women and girls ask themselves, ""Am I good enough,"" and she says the correct answer is ""Yes I am.""In the book she also say as she left her husband alone working at night in the Treaty Room into morning hours, she wondered sometimes if his more than 300 constituents knew how lucky they were (he was president).  I can answer that. ""Yes we did!""And to this day millions of us weep because he is no longer president and now no one is working in the Treaty Room to protect us.

  I thought she did an really good job of showing us the human side of who she and Barack were. If a buddy of yours grew up to become the president or first spouse, and it was sort of a fairy tale, a book like this would show the underside, or the real side, of the process.Just like Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance, this book shows us how some Americans ""make it"" from the ground up, but that it's not easy. Making it is a quicksilver process, requiring such ingredients as intelligence, timing, hard work, luck, happenstance....it's scary how many things can impede the chances of good, smart kids. Michelle Obama chronicles how she managed to make it, and she deserved her good fortune, but she would be the first to tell you a lot of it wasn't up to her. Which makes you sad about all the kids left behind. Or let's be honest: all the kids who are murdered before they can fulfill their potential. Obama is frank with kids who're struggling against the odds, and in this as in so many other issues, she doesn't get down and helpless over the burdens. She encourages us to accept what is and work around it. I found that empowering.Her description of meeting and getting to know, then falling in love with, Barack, is really interesting. It was NOT love at first sight! They became friends, and then sweethearts, and then, over time, deeply in love. We get to see what Barack is like--truly, that's the stellar aspect of this book, it's so candid! Michelle isn't afraid to complain and speak honestly; she struggles as a young adult and a working mother, then as a political spouse. You really see the sausage-works of political campaigns.The book wasn't gripping, but it was interesting. I've always thought she was super-smart and clever, and that seems true, but when she mentions she's not overly introspective, I found that hard to believe. However, by the end of the book, I wondered if it was true, because she minimized some events in her life that would have been compelling had she gone deeper. She was the first / only black woman to do X, Y, and Z. I feel quite sure she ran into a hell of a lot more obstacles than she shares, and in that sense, she kind of minimizes her astronomical climb. How many kids from the hood get into Princeton and Harvard, and then succeed as well as she did? And when she got hired at the white-shoe law firm, what did that really feel like? Ah, well. A missed opportunity.There is so much to like about this book, the little vignettes about life in the White House, for example. The policy issues were less interesting; the human issues more so. All in all, a worthwhile and enjoyable read.

  Never have I ever wished I was illiterate, until now. I have read some god awful books in my day, but this one takes the cake by far. I will admit, however, I do have a favorite part of this putrid dive into the life of former First Lady, Michelle Obama (Mad respect by the way; Love women, hate terrible books that make me want to rip my eyes out), and that is when I was able to close the back cover and toss this waste of a tree into a dumpster behind a local Long John Silver's. I would have returned this book and asked for a complete refund, but all of King Midas' silver couldn't give me back the time I wasted reading this tasteless piece of garbage. I support reading!

  First of all, I’m happy to report that I’m writing this review AFTER I read the book, and it’s not completely based on my past and present political views.With that being said, I didn’t completely love the book. I was expecting Michelle Obama to be a little less guarded in it, and go a little deeper into her personal thoughts and struggles; to be a little bit more candid. I also wanted to find out more about how life is in the White House. On all of those fronts, this book mostly doesn’t deliver.Mrs. Obama is an incredibly intelligent woman, and on top of that, she is a lawyer with an Ivy League education. That background has largely influenced this book, which feels like it’s been edited for any possibility of risky statements or disclosures. It feels too safe, too guarded to really be authentic. She focuses a lot on presenting a very clean version of her life (her family was perfect; it was loving and supportive, her mom was without any faults, her father was equally perfect and he handled his disability with pride and no complaints). Is that realistic…? While her family sure must’ve been quite amazing, and I’m sure she loved it very much, nothing and no one is really perfect. I just couldn’t buy it.For some reason she barely mentions Harvard. She goes into quite a bit of detail about being a black woman at Princeton, but she dedicates maybe a half of a page in the book to her time at Harvard mostly talking about how she didn’t have time to reflect on what she wanted to do in life during the intense studies to obtain her law degree. That’s it. It made me very curious about what happened at Harvard and why she or Harvard itself didn’t want that to be in the book.She is clear about not liking politics and not really wanting to be in politics, but provides very little insight into how she transformed from that stage to seeming to really enjoy being the First Lady (she was terrified Barack Obama wouldn’t be elected for the second term). She mentions very little about her marital struggles. She does say at some point they went to counseling, but again, it’s a brief mention, and ends at that. She seems to describe nothing but only marital bliss after that.I did appreciate that she mentioned having a miscarriage, having to go through IVF to conceive, failing her bar exam at the first try and getting into Harvard from a waiting list. But I did notice one thing about the tone of the book; Michelle Obama is determined not to focus on anything negative. She mentions her miscarriage very briefly and almost dismissingly by saying that they’re very common and happen to more women than we all think. That again, takes about a half a page to a full page. Her IVF is mentioned, but again quite briefly.She describes her life almost with a sense of distance at times. Focusing on events not feelings or emotions. There were few passages of the book that felt more personal, and I enjoyed them. The part where she says she skipped the final ball of the inauguration night (the one she was most looking forward too), because she was simply too exhausted to go. There is a part where she writes about Sasha thinking that nobody came to see Barack Obama’s acceptance speech the night of the first election because the streets were empty, and that in that moment she realized that they were emptied because now they were traveling with the President Elect. She describes how it felt like to see for the first time the heavy security surrounding her husband when he became the president with the massive helicopters, motorcade, snipers, secret agents, etc. That gave me goosebumps. I enjoyed reading about that tender moment when Malia got an ear infection on vacation in Hawaii, and when Barack Obama had to choose between leaving her and Michelle Obama alone to travel back home to cast a vote (an important one) in the senate or staying with his family (which did need him).I was disappointed that she didn’t write about how life has been after leaving the White House. Yes, there is that one toast she made, but other than that, it’s mostly undisclosed in the book. Do they miss it? Do they get to enjoy their lives now more? What’s next for them (other than creating a foundation in Chicago)? The book doesn’t talk about that.In summary, I do recommend the book. Michelle Obama is a good writer, and she is likable. She writes about race, and family life, and being a working mother, and friendships, and politics. It’s still an interesting read, if not a little bit too safe.

  Im not sure what Michelle was trying to accomplish by writing this book. It was obviously over hyped and pointless ! I kept reading hoping that it would get better but it never did. I must say that the parts where she talks about Obama’s upbringing are probably the only areas of the entire book that were actually interesting. I understand Michelle was trying to find a way to connect to a certain audience but she wasn’t genuine and she just sounded like an entitled whiner. She did not have it hard growing up and instead of trying to sound like she did, she should have spoken about how lucky she was to have been brought up in such a normal life. Instead she focused on the fact that she is a woman of color, which should not define her. The entire book is her complaining about her life and trying to save face from some interviews she did while Obama was campaigning. She was never really supportive of her husband but rather “dragged along for the ride” and did things to “check it off her list”. I know Oprah had this book in her book club (hence why i read it) but now i see it was her doing her friend (Michelle) a favor. This book was terrible.

I always read the First Ladies books that they write after leaving office and have loved every one of them.  I get the feeling that Michele was trying desperately to fulfill her contractual obligation to her publisher but just could not work up the enthusiasm to make it interesting.  Also, it seems that she didn't keep a journal from which to recall her eight years in the White House. When Barak's book comes out, it wil be a wonderful book because he is a gifted writer.  After all that said, I do like the Obamas very much and miss them In the White House.

  This book attempts to make the former First Lady ""one of the common people.""  The early part of this autobiography is readable and interesting, but the later narrative tries too hard to be down-to-earth.  Really?  Once one has lived in The White House, one is forever promised a life of privilege.  To deny otherwise is not truthful.But those $3400 Balenciaga boots?  The narrative now seems totally false with a ""let them eat cake"" attitude.  (She is entitled to wear those boots and can afford them, but she could have at least worn less pricey shoes and clothes for her book tour.)The current First Lady (Mrs. Trump) is also under scrutiny for her looks, fashions and White House decor decisions.  Her son also also come under media criticism.It's part of being in the public eye and to give it credence is beneath the dignity of a First Lady.

  This was not a book I had planned to read because I am a Conservatve and did not vote for Obama. However, A Book Group I am in chose to read it, so I read it. I was charmed during the first 3/4's of the book, and had begun to reassess my  previous thoughts on the Obama Presidency. I was excited at how Michelle wanted the Republicans and Demoncrats to care more about passing appropriat legislations, than fighting their party line. But then in the last part of the book, she put down Trump very aggressiviely which really turned me off, because I felt she now had just turned against her integrity of the first part of her book. Too bad she did not follow through on her early non-partisan views.

  Despite my waning eyesight and the horrific pain that is part and parcel of living with a terminal illness, I couldn't put this book down. For 2 straight days, every moment I was awake was spent with Michelle Obama's written voice, reminding me of better times when I'd dared to feel emotions such as hope. The Obamas have only been retired for 2 years, but it feels like 20 lifetimes have passed. If there is anything even quasi-positive that can be said of the current, hideous presidency, it's that trump has managed to make whatever time I've got left feel excruciatingly longer.""Becoming"" is a bittersweet read, but excellent nonetheless. After finishing it (I even read the acknowledgments!) I closed the book and cried for a bit, allowing myself to wonder for the first time how different my illness might have turned out if the GOP cared even 1/100th as much as the Obamas did and do about the wellbeing of ALL Americans. Put bluntly, had the Republicans not put an axe to Obamacare, I might have stood a chance. I might have lived long enough to welcome my first grandchild into the world or travel to all the places I've only dreamt of experiencing. At the very least, were it not for a vestige of slavery known as the electoral college I'd be able to afford medical care and medicinal relief from the all-consuming pain.Beyond how the book personally affected me, there is so much to be learned from it. From little bits of trivia (I had no idea the 1st family has to pay for their own food and highly doubt the current occupants do) to the Obamas relationship with Queen Elizabeth II, ""Becoming"" was utterly absorbing. It was heartwarming and at times heart-wrenching to watch President Obama's ascent through his wife's loving eyes. You could tell how much it affected the 1st Lady to see her husband grieve over the death of his mother, a doting mom who--had she been able to hold on just a couple months more--would have seen her son elected to the US Senate. And then to watch the very same thing happen all over again to his grandmother directly prior to being elected President of the United States... lets just say you really feel for all affected parties when reading the story through Mrs. Obama's eyes.What was especially refreshing was the candor with which the book was written. She didn't gloss over her personal imperfections in the hopes of coming across as saint-like nor did she whine about the unfairness of things Republicans and the media did to her even though it would be understandable if she had. (She's definitely a stronger woman than I am!) All in all, the beauty of the book was in the realization that Michelle Obama unfiltered is just as inspiring, hopeful, and dignified as the Michelle Obama who'd been constrained by the office of 1st Lady for 8 years.It's impossible to finish this book without remembering how truly lucky we were as a nation to live under the loving, devoted leadership of a man wholly dedicated to serving our country with every fiber of his being. He gave 110% of himself even to those who'd made up their minds to despise him. I have to say it broke my heart reading about all the Obamas did with and for the military when that same military all too often talks of him like something they stepped in. O'Neill, for instance, the Seal who happened to fire the kill shot at bin laden, frequently disparages President Obama on Twitter. (He also makes sickening references to the way he killed 1 of bin laden's sons.) O'Neill looooves trump of course--a treasonist, KGB loving coward--but disparages the very man who gave that Seal his opportunity to go from an unknown soldier to a recognized somebody. Unfortunately, O'Neill is neither the 1st nor last seal I've heard discuss President Obama in a negative light. That newly elected congressman with the eyepatch who got into it with SNL recently said on ""New Day"" that seal morale is high under trump, but was low under Obama. I don't know what the hell is being taught to the seals, but the vast majority of the ones I've heard speak have been blatant racists. What has trump done for them other than be white? He doesn't visit combat zones, he disparages gold star families, and he couldn't be further up Putin's ass if he tried to be, but morale is high? Ooookay.Despite 8 years of watching Michelle Obama be called everything from an ape to a ""tranny"" she still believes in going high when others go low. Pat Robertson was scandalized when she dared to wear sleeveless dresses, but claims melania trump's nude lesbian photos are ""art."" This alleged Christian man saw neither grace nor beauty in Michelle and her daughters, but insists that the KGB plant living in the white house (aka Svetlana ""I Don't Really Care Do You?"" trump) has both of those attributes. Umm... really?! The woman has had so much plastic surgery that she barely has eye sockets left. But melania is a white, racist, unapologetic birther so the ""good"" pastor apparently finds grace and beauty in her anyway. (Come to think of it, Pat Robertson is probably the seals' official spiritual advisor.)I don't give a damn what the racists say; Michelle and her daughters are gorgeous inside and out. Their beauty isn't bought in stores or under a plastic surgeon's scalpel. Their toned physiques and radiant skin pay testament to lives lived healthy, happy, and well. Their regal features are striking in their elegance and beauty. And come on now, Michelle Obama's ever so slight overbite is downright adorable!Michelle Obama remains my 1st Lady just as President Obama remains my president. I genuinely admire their ability to go high, but I don't think I'm capable of becoming that person again. Every day I grow a little weaker, every day the pain becomes a little less tolerable, and every night I go to sleep knowing the odds of waking back up become less favorable each time. This book took me back to a better time and place, to the person I'd been the whole of my life prior to 2016. I thank Mrs. Obama for that parting gift. I'll sleep tonight feeling more at peace.*****UPDATE 9/24/19*****I’m happy to say I’m still ticking (knock on wood!) After almost dying in the hospital, I was able to get an in-state waiver which—long story short—allowed me to receive Medicaid. Medicaid doesn’t pay for as much as one would hope so I still struggle to get the care & meds I need, but at least I have some level of care and some meds now. A big thank you to those of you who reached out to me with your uplifting words filled with genuine kindness :)

  First and foremost, Michelle Obama thoughtfully demonstrated the dilemma of balancing family and a professional life as a wife and mother. The book also demonstrates the qualities of a good marriage and remaining true to yourself when everything you believe in is distorted by political power. I especially love her honesty, beautiful humility, and her obvious love for humanity.I applaud the fact the book was not overwhelmingly about her husband. However, sometimes it seeps through just a bit too much. This is natural because the woman loves him deeply and he is an inseparable part of her being.  This is where I thought the book lacked some discipline. I expected her to go deeper. I wanted to know more about her thought processes, what makes her think like she thinks, who of what shaped her life philosophically, an analysis of her legal mind.I read this beautiful memoir but I leave still not knowing the woman. I think there is still another book in Ms. Obama—a more analytic one.  She is much smarter than this book alone.

  I enjoyed every page of the book. It was a quick easy read. Michelle Obama let me as a reader see the real “Michelle “ and not as the  media portrayed her. She revealed the worries every mother has about her kids, she talks about insecurities as a woman we all feel but will not say in public. The revelation of knowing you can do more but having to sacrifice your dream or put it on hold for family and country and putting yourself last is real and I am glad she said it out loud.

  She is one of the most gracious First Ladies of the USA. I love her memoir, she is very straightforward and honest about the challenges of being the first black ""First Lady"", what I specifically relate to is in her Preface when she wrote that she has been the only black person in a number of rooms - this resonant with me because as a Chinese-American married to a white guy who is an officer in the US Army, I am usually the only Asian person in a number of rooms myself... and while the military is very diverse on the enlisted side, it is still very predominantly white in the officer side; you definitely notice the feeling of being an outsider during spouse events. A very good read and inspiring book for any woman.

  She states in the Preface of this 2018 autobiography, “So far in my life, I’ve been a lawyer. I’ve been a vice president at a hospital and the director of a nonprofit that helps young people build meaningful careers. I’ve been a working-class black student at a fancy mostly white college… And until recently, I was the First lady of the United States of America---a job that’s not officially a job, but that nonetheless has given me a platform like nothing I could have imagined… I’ve been hurt. I’ve been furious. But mostly, I’ve tried to laugh this stuff off.” (Pg. ix-x) But now, “My husband is making his own adjustments to life after the White House, catching his own breath. And here I am, in this new place, with a lot I want to say.” (Pg. xiii)When she was admitted to Princeton University, she noted, “it was impossible to be a black kid at a mostly white school and not feel the shadow of affirmative action. You could almost read the scrutiny in the gaze of certain students and even some professors, as if they wanted to say, ‘I know why YOU’RE here.’ … My job, as I saw it, was to hold steady, earn the best grades I could, and get myself through… There were so few of us minority kids at Princeton, I suppose, that our presence was always conspicuous. I mainly took this as a mandate to overperform… by a feeling of ‘I’ll show you.’ … now at Princeton I was representing my race. Anytime I found my voice in class or nailed an exam, I quietly hoped it helped make a larger point.” (Pg, 78-80)When she graduated and was working at a high-end law firm, she was asked by a senior partner to “mentor an incoming summer associate,” and she recalls, “like you, he’s black and from Harvard. Other than that, you know nothing---just the name, and it’s an odd one.” (Pg. 92-93) She continues, “Barack Obama had already created a stir at the firm… rumor had it that he was exceptional… Some of the secretaries … were saying that on top of this apparent brilliance he was also cute… Very quickly, I realized that Barack would need little in the way of advice. He was three years older than I was… He was breezy in his manner but powerful in his mind. It was a strange, stirring combination…  Not once, though, did I think about him as someone I’d want to date… He would be, I thought to myself, a good summer mentee.” (Pg. 96-99) She did, however, reprove him for smoking; but “Smoking was the one topic where Barack’s logic seemed to leave him altogether.” (Pg. 103)Listening to one of Barack’s presentations to a community group, she reflected, “I’d never been with someone who dwelled on the more demoralizing parts of being African American. I’d been raised to think positively… But listening to Barack, I began to understand that his version of hope reached far beyond mine. It was one thing to get yourself out of a stuck place, I realized. It was another thing entirely to try and get the place itself unstuck… I was convinced, too.” (Pg. 117-118)Ultimately, she realized, “I hated being a lawyer. I wasn’t suited to the work. I felt empty doing it, even if I was plenty good at it… In my blinding drive to excel… I’d missed the signs and taken the wrong road.” (Pg. 132) But she and Barack had been together for a year-and-a-half, and were beginning to discuss marriage. (Pg. 139-140) While Barack finished at Harvard, for two years they were a “long-distance couple.” (Pg. 151-152) Once they were back in the same city after his graduation, “His was the lone voice telling me to just go for it, to erase the worries and go toward whatever I thought would make me happy… ‘You can do this. We’ll figure it out.’” (Pg. 151-153) After he took his bar exam, they went out to dinner to celebrate, he proposed marriage in the restaurant. “When I said yes, it seemed that every person in the whole restaurant started to clap.” (Pg. 157)She began working for an organization called Public Allies, which recruited talented young people, and placed them in internship positions in nonprofit and public sector work. “For the first time in my life, really, I felt I was doing something meaningful, directly impacting the lives of others while also staying connected to both my city and my culture.” (Pg. 180)She wasn’t always enthusiastic about Barack running for office. When he ran for the Illinois senate in 1996, “I just believed there were better ways for a good person to have an impact. Quite honestly, I thought he’d get eaten alive… [But] If Barack believed he could do something in politics, who was I to get in his way?.. And so I gave my wifely approval to his first run for office, larding it with a bit of wifely caution.” (Pg. 183) Later, she observed, “this I know for sure about my husband. You don’t dangle an opportunity in front of him… and expect him to just walk away. Because he doesn’t. He won’t.” (Pg. 193)They now had two daughters, and Barack was often away from home, or coming home late. “I spent so much energy stewing over whether he’d make it home for dinner that dinners, with or without him, were no longer fun. This was my pivot point, my moment of self-arrest… I drove my ax into the ground… [The girls and I} made our schedule and stuck to it… I didn’t want them ever to believe that life began when the man of the house arrived home. We didn’t wait for Dad. It was his job to catch up with us.” (Pg. 206-207)When they moved to Washington after Barack was elected to the Senate, she mused, “Washington confused me, with its decorous traditions and sober self-regard… At the heart of my confusion was a kind of fear, because as much as I hadn’t chosen to be involved, I was getting sucked in.” (Pg. 219) When he contemplated running for President, “In the end it boiled down to this: I said yes because I believed that Barack could be a great president… I said yes because I loved him and had faith in what he could do… But I’d seen enough of the divisions to temper my own hopes. Barack was a black man in America, after all. I didn’t really think he could win.” (Pg. 226) Later, she explains, “Barack was the right man for this moment in history, for a job that was never going to be easy but that had grown, thanks to the financial crisis, exponentially more difficult… We’d be foolish at this point not to put him in office. Still, he would inherit a mess.” (Pg. 275-276)After he was elected, she lamented, “There is no handbook for incoming First Ladies of the United States.” (Pg. 283) She realized, “I understood already that I’d be measured by a different yardstick. As the only African American First Lady to set foot in the White House, I was ‘other’ almost by default… I had to be better, faster, smarter, and stronger than ever. My grace would need to be earned…” (Pg. 283-284) But Laura Bush and departing President George Bush welcomed her warmly, “possessing a magnanimous Texas spirit that seemed to override any political hard feelings.” (Pg. 289)And of course, here is the part of the book that so upset the current POTUS: “Trump was now actively working to revive the [“birther”] argument… The whole thing was crazy and mean-spirited, of course, its underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly concealed. But it was also dangerous, deliberately meant to stir up wingnuts and kooks… I was briefed from time to time by the Secret Service on the more serious threats that came in… Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendoes, was putting my family’s safety at risk. And for this, I’d never forgive him.” (Pg. 352-353)She explains, “We didn’t join a church in Washington, because we didn’t want to subject another congregation to the kind of bad-faith attacks that had rained down on Trinity, our church in Chicago. It was a sacrifice, though. I missed the warmth of a spiritual community.” (Pg. 353)As Trump was campaigning in 2016, and Michelle and Barak were both campaigning for Hillary Clinton, “There was a motto Barack and I tried to live by, and I offered it that night from the stage: ‘When they go low, we go high.’” (Pg. 407) But after Trump won the election, she reflected, “I won’t try to speculate about who was responsible or what was unfair. I just wish more people had turned out to vote. And I will always wonder about what led to many women… [to] choose a misogynist as their president. But the result was now ours to live with.” (Pg. 411)She concludes, “I think what I experienced during those years is what many did---a sense of progress, the comfort of compassion, the joy of watching the unsung and invisible find some light. A glimmer of the world as it could be…. Whatever was coming next, this was a story we could own.” (Pg. 416)This is a fascinating, emotionally- and intelligently-written memoir, that is a worthy and heart-stirring reminder of what the Presidency, and the First Lady, USED to be like… Hopefully, such days will one day return again...

  She states in the Preface of this 2018 autobiography, “So far in my life, I’ve been a lawyer. I’ve been a vice president at a hospital and the director of a nonprofit that helps young people build meaningful careers. I’ve been a working-class black student at a fancy mostly white college… And until recently, I was the First lady of the United States of America---a job that’s not officially a job, but that nonetheless has given me a platform like nothing I could have imagined… I’ve been hurt. I’ve been furious. But mostly, I’ve tried to laugh this stuff off.” (Pg. ix-x) But now, “My husband is making his own adjustments to life after the White House, catching his own breath. And here I am, in this new place, with a lot I want to say.” (Pg. xiii)When she was admitted to Princeton University, she noted, “it was impossible to be a black kid at a mostly white school and not feel the shadow of affirmative action. You could almost read the scrutiny in the gaze of certain students and even some professors, as if they wanted to say, ‘I know why YOU’RE here.’ … My job, as I saw it, was to hold steady, earn the best grades I could, and get myself through… There were so few of us minority kids at Princeton, I suppose, that our presence was always conspicuous. I mainly took this as a mandate to overperform… by a feeling of ‘I’ll show you.’ … now at Princeton I was representing my race. Anytime I found my voice in class or nailed an exam, I quietly hoped it helped make a larger point.” (Pg, 78-80)When she graduated and was working at a high-end law firm, she was asked by a senior partner to “mentor an incoming summer associate,” and she recalls, “like you, he’s black and from Harvard. Other than that, you know nothing---just the name, and it’s an odd one.” (Pg. 92-93) She continues, “Barack Obama had already created a stir at the firm… rumor had it that he was exceptional… Some of the secretaries … were saying that on top of this apparent brilliance he was also cute… Very quickly, I realized that Barack would need little in the way of advice. He was three years older than I was… He was breezy in his manner but powerful in his mind. It was a strange, stirring combination…  Not once, though, did I think about him as someone I’d want to date… He would be, I thought to myself, a good summer mentee.” (Pg. 96-99) She did, however, reprove him for smoking; but “Smoking was the one topic where Barack’s logic seemed to leave him altogether.” (Pg. 103)Listening to one of Barack’s presentations to a community group, she reflected, “I’d never been with someone who dwelled on the more demoralizing parts of being African American. I’d been raised to think positively… But listening to Barack, I began to understand that his version of hope reached far beyond mine. It was one thing to get yourself out of a stuck place, I realized. It was another thing entirely to try and get the place itself unstuck… I was convinced, too.” (Pg. 117-118)Ultimately, she realized, “I hated being a lawyer. I wasn’t suited to the work. I felt empty doing it, even if I was plenty good at it… In my blinding drive to excel… I’d missed the signs and taken the wrong road.” (Pg. 132) But she and Barack had been together for a year-and-a-half, and were beginning to discuss marriage. (Pg. 139-140) While Barack finished at Harvard, for two years they were a “long-distance couple.” (Pg. 151-152) Once they were back in the same city after his graduation, “His was the lone voice telling me to just go for it, to erase the worries and go toward whatever I thought would make me happy… ‘You can do this. We’ll figure it out.’” (Pg. 151-153) After he took his bar exam, they went out to dinner to celebrate, he proposed marriage in the restaurant. “When I said yes, it seemed that every person in the whole restaurant started to clap.” (Pg. 157)She began working for an organization called Public Allies, which recruited talented young people, and placed them in internship positions in nonprofit and public sector work. “For the first time in my life, really, I felt I was doing something meaningful, directly impacting the lives of others while also staying connected to both my city and my culture.” (Pg. 180)She wasn’t always enthusiastic about Barack running for office. When he ran for the Illinois senate in 1996, “I just believed there were better ways for a good person to have an impact. Quite honestly, I thought he’d get eaten alive… [But] If Barack believed he could do something in politics, who was I to get in his way?.. And so I gave my wifely approval to his first run for office, larding it with a bit of wifely caution.” (Pg. 183) Later, she observed, “this I know for sure about my husband. You don’t dangle an opportunity in front of him… and expect him to just walk away. Because he doesn’t. He won’t.” (Pg. 193)They now had two daughters, and Barack was often away from home, or coming home late. “I spent so much energy stewing over whether he’d make it home for dinner that dinners, with or without him, were no longer fun. This was my pivot point, my moment of self-arrest… I drove my ax into the ground… [The girls and I} made our schedule and stuck to it… I didn’t want them ever to believe that life began when the man of the house arrived home. We didn’t wait for Dad. It was his job to catch up with us.” (Pg. 206-207)When they moved to Washington after Barack was elected to the Senate, she mused, “Washington confused me, with its decorous traditions and sober self-regard… At the heart of my confusion was a kind of fear, because as much as I hadn’t chosen to be involved, I was getting sucked in.” (Pg. 219) When he contemplated running for President, “In the end it boiled down to this: I said yes because I believed that Barack could be a great president… I said yes because I loved him and had faith in what he could do… But I’d seen enough of the divisions to temper my own hopes. Barack was a black man in America, after all. I didn’t really think he could win.” (Pg. 226) Later, she explains, “Barack was the right man for this moment in history, for a job that was never going to be easy but that had grown, thanks to the financial crisis, exponentially more difficult… We’d be foolish at this point not to put him in office. Still, he would inherit a mess.” (Pg. 275-276)After he was elected, she lamented, “There is no handbook for incoming First Ladies of the United States.” (Pg. 283) She realized, “I understood already that I’d be measured by a different yardstick. As the only African American First Lady to set foot in the White House, I was ‘other’ almost by default… I had to be better, faster, smarter, and stronger than ever. My grace would need to be earned…” (Pg. 283-284) But Laura Bush and departing President George Bush welcomed her warmly, “possessing a magnanimous Texas spirit that seemed to override any political hard feelings.” (Pg. 289)And of course, here is the part of the book that so upset the current POTUS: “Trump was now actively working to revive the [“birther”] argument… The whole thing was crazy and mean-spirited, of course, its underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly concealed. But it was also dangerous, deliberately meant to stir up wingnuts and kooks… I was briefed from time to time by the Secret Service on the more serious threats that came in… Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendoes, was putting my family’s safety at risk.

  I have done nothing today except Read this book and all I can say is wow!!! I am not a Michelle Obama huge fan; I am a conservative; so president Obama’s policies were not always always popular with me. But after reading this book from Michelle’s point of view,  from one wife to another,  and one mother to another, one human to another, I feel the earnest honesty and sincerity in its pages; I sense her optimism; and at times I caught myself laughing out loud and even crying along with her. So many emotions reading this book, but in the end, I am so glad that the Obamas came out victorious through all they had to go through, especially mrs Obama. I will always appreciate her after reading this book. And I pray earnestly for this counry/ that decency will once again be the norm.  God bless you mrs Obama; you are truly a remarkable woman; praying for God to bless you and your precious family.Addendum: 2 weeks after my initial review: I love Michelle Obama!this book made me live her. I am re reading it again; I hardly hardly ever do that, and I am recommending this book to anyone who would listen. Bless you Mrs. Obama!

  This book is a waste of time and money- glad I did not buy it.  ""I love me"" is written all over it.  Yes, she got into Princeton due to affirmative action.  She was extremely lucky in some ways, but she talks all about her tough struggles.  Lady, you have never really had a true struggle- all you describe are things that many people deal with.  Some of the book seems kind of contrived and false, too.  Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money elsewhere.

  Laughable at best. Telling her story as if its relatable at all and as if it would give any of us any motivation.

  ABSOLUTELY AMAZING & INSPIRING!!!!!  Becoming allowed me an opportunity to experience the human side of the Obama family which further increased my admiration!  I laughed, cried and felt inspired while enjoying the authentic and transparent experiences that were unapologetically shared throughout this wonderfully written memoir. Typically I prefer to read my books however, I intentionally chose to purchase through audible because I wanted my experience to be more like a personal conversation that allowed me to just sit and listen....I will forever love this First Family for many reasons.  I also gained increased respect for other former first families who held nothing back in supporting the Obama's transition into the White House.  We see a glimpse of the intimate relationships between the families in the media but the book demonstrates the sincerity displayed by the Bush, Clinton and Reagan families respectively.

  Michelle has been who she is even when she was a First Lady. It’s people like me want to see something greater than what she wants to be. “Michelle is not Hillary!” Not interested in politics. However, there are always sacrifices to make at a personal level when you work for a greater cause. And, I’m disappointed is because when you have an extraordinary opportunity why waste it on not so significant matters.Michelle’s, Eat Well, Let’s Move are great initiatives but it became clear to me that Michelle had better success when she worked in Chicago Medical Center and other agencies that I don’t remember names she has it in the book. It proves, ‘You can’t Sheppard sheep sitting on an a camel’, a saying I know. Her accomplishments as a First Lady didn’t match to the changes she had accomplished in her work in Chicago.”My husband,” Michelle often refers to Barack as ‘My husband,’ this sounds like wife of 1950s. as if he is her property she proudly proclaims. Just say, Barack, we Love him as that, Barack Obama our president.And, his greatness becomes very clear as she writes about their initial interactions. He knew what he needed to achieve and regardless of financial gains, he went for it. He had clear goals and he too achieved those as a community organizer than as a president. Because he had to deal with Republicans in Washington.I liked the first part of the book about her childhood, her college years and her meeting with Obama, it were interesting parts. The First Lady in White House, Not much interesting. Maybe because we knew all of it, where she went, who she talked to, her protected daughters etc., nothing new that she has verbalized to redundancy. No other dimension was added, I simply scrolled down half of the book! Sadly!

  Becoming is such a refreshing book. Michelle makes all ambitious women (or women for that matter) feel normal. Everything from marriage, parenting, love, self-doubt, fear and so much more was covered in this book. This wasn't a typical memoir - Michelle's message is simple, if I can you can. I'm just like you. Love the stories she shares around marriage therapy and hiring a cook. OMG! This is for the high-achiever who thinks something is wrong with being driven, you will enjoy her real and raw stories that uplifts and empowers.  Had to get copies for my girlfriends.

  On January 17, 1964, a baby girl was born to Marian and Fraser Robinson. They named her Michelle LaVaughn Robinson. The family, which also included older brother Craig, lived on the second floor of a small house on the south side of Chicago. The house was owned by Mrs. Robinson's aunt who lived on the first floor, where she gave piano lessons during the day.  Mrs. Robinson was a stay at home mom, but Mr. Robinson never missed a day of work at the water filtration plant where he was employed, in spite of suffering the debilitating effects of multiple sclerosis. There was never a lot of extra money, but the home was filled with love, books, and music, and the kids were surrounded by a close knit extended family.No one would have imagined that the little girl living in this house would go on to graduate from Princeton and Harvard Law School. Or that she would fall in love with and marry a man named Barack Obama, and the two of them would one day become President and First Lady of the United States.I enjoyed this book immensely. There is so much to admire about Michelle Obama. I will just mention a couple of them.  In her role as First Lady, she advocated tirelessly for children.  She fought to get more nutritious meals in school cafeterias and more physical education to combat childhood obesity.  But what I admire the most is her grace and dignity. In spite of the vitriolic crap thrown at her, in spite of the lies told about her and her husband, and the overt racism, she never lowered herself to their level. ""When they go low, we go high"" may or may not have been the best policy politically, but it is who she is.Michelle Obama has made a positive difference in so many lives. She will be turning 55 in a few weeks. I don't know what her future plans are, but I know one thing for sure.  She, and her husband, will continue to make this world a better place.Five stars for her book. A whole sky full of stars for her.

  Reading Michelle Obama’s Becoming I committed something of a sin—a literary sin to be sure.  Or maybe it’s not but I certainly feel as though it was.Michelle Obama is an amazing woman.  For her to go to Princeton, then to Harvard Law, then go on to attain a high paying job as an attorney is nothing short of amazing.  Yet, as she detailed her life: her ups and downs, her accomplishments and setbacks, her likes and dislikes, her strengths and weaknesses, her comforts and fears—basically exposing herself to the world—I still found myself most interested when she spoke about Barack.  And for that I feel guilty.I feel guilty because this book is her book, it’s supposed to be about her life and truly I bought it for that reason.  I wanted to know about Michelle because I’ve always admired her.  Yet, now I think there was a hidden part of me that just wanted to know more about Barack Obama but just from a different angle.  As if I tried to convince myself that I wanted Michelle when secretly I wanted her as a means of access to Barack.And to be fair, Barack isn’t just anybody.  This was the president of the United States.  The first black president in the history of the country.  So, it’s only natural to have more than a passing interest in him.Like I said though, I bought the book to know more about Michelle.  Although she began the book chronicling her upbringing in South Side Chicago things kicked into high gear once she became the FLOTUS. Just daily life as the First Lady was an ordeal that many people, myself included, are not aware of.  She gives the reader an inside tour of her life in the White House with all the pomp and circumstance that surrounds it that you otherwise wouldn’t be privy to.She covers the difficulties and the annoyances that come with being the First Lady and the First Family.  She doesn’t mention them in a complaining manner like “woe is me,” but rather in a matter of fact manner as in, “I can’t just go outside for fresh air because of security concerns.” But as she mentions these things she makes sure to mention that her life is considerably more privileged than the vast majority of people and she’s incredibly grateful for it.Beyond the logistical changes in her life she touches on the emotional changes she wasn’t ready for.  She grew up caring about what people thought about her.  She explained how when she was younger she loved to see people beam when she told them how she wanted to be a pediatrician when she grew up.  She loved that family and friends were proud of her accomplishments.  So, when she became the First Lady and started to be attacked for everything from her clothes to her facial expressions it hurt her.  In what can only be called incredible candor she reveals how hurt she was by the words and opinions of others.Michelle shows us the humanness behind the icon.  She is a public political figure that maybe people consider a lifeless soulless person that’s there for our entertainment or to be an object of our derision.  Michelle, through this book, breathes life into the photos and the videos of the tall dark woman married to the president.  This book gives us insight on Michelle Obama the person as well as Michelle Obama the First Lady of the United States.

  1. I voted for Barack H. Obama twice.2. Before I read this book, I would've voted Michelle Obama had she ever shown an inkling of interest.3. I have absolutely positively no tolerance for 45, his wife and the entire spectacle of him since 2016.4. I respect Michelle Obama's health initiative. She seems funny, in-the-know and bright. I also think she looks absolutely stunning on the cover and wouldn't change it for the world.And then I opened the cover. At first I thought I was having a hard time reading the book because Oprah Winfrey just KEPT doing interviews about it. She did an interview in her own magazine, then an interview with a book excerpt from Elle. Then she did a special series talking about the book. And Oprah just kept giving away the best parts. So I purposely started ignoring all the interviews and excerpts. It was starting to feel like that agonizingly annoying person who talks through a movie and then tells you the ending.And it's not like I was going to be surprised that her ""husband"" (which she kept saying an odd amount of times for someone who big-upped Mary Tyler Moore for being so independent) won. I couldn't have been more ecstatic for him. But I went into the book thinking it would be all about her time at the White House, and quite a bit of the first part was about her before she met former President Obama. And as cruel as it may sound, and I did not want to admit it at the time, I just didn't care. I wasn't particularly interested in why she kept staying in the apartment above her parents even with a $120K salary. I didn't care about why she rudely dumped her boyfriend before college. I didn't care about school bullies or the way she treated her Barbie dolls or some of the other random details that just didn't matter. But I pushed through them.I enjoyed the parts about her father because these were little details we got while she was in the White House, and I thought from both a health and cultural standpoint, it was fascinating to hear how he dealt with MS. Her Jamaican friend who died of cancer was also someone I was interested in. The reason these two topics were interesting to me were because they had actual stories behind them. Her late friend sounded like a barrel of fun.But I still was pulling my way through the book.Then I got to the chapter in which she met former President Obama and THAT'S when my eyes lit up and I smiled. This was exactly what I wanted to read. I rolled my eyes at the snarky comments about his ""weird"" name. Never did understand that criticism. By living on the southside of Chicago, we've both heard ""weird"" (unusual) names all the time. It's really not worth mocking over and over again in interviews and in person. But I was still sold.I already enjoyed both of his books, the first one more than the second, and she made him seem even more likable and even-tempered than I already heard. Meanwhile she seemed a bit confused by his need for alone time and described herself as, for lack of a better word, clingy. He gets a book deal and needs to write it. She feels like it's a ""honeymoon"" away from her. He's not much of a phone person. She makes a snide comment about him not talking to her on the phone more means she'll talk to someone else. There were a lot of strange moments like that, and it made me go, ""Wait, you're FLOTUS, and your own words are making me like you less.""She definitely seemed REALLY wrapped up in the husbands and kids end goal, which is fine for women who also have a similar goal. (I'm on the fence.) I genuinely think I would've related to her more if I was someone who had a goal of motherhood. She started losing me. But then she confused me because she also seemed to challenge women who think that motherhood and a husband will suffice. She said she wanted to be like her mother -- but then not at all like her mother. So that was confusing to say the least.I still read on. Still determined to like her. And then I got to the chapter when Malia got a little sick. And then-Senator Obama would've had to go to Springfield to sign a crime bill. He did not. She admitted that she could've handled this situation on her own, but she never offered the option to the then-senator. Her response: ""I didn't care."" And that sat with me so wrong that I closed the book.I thought that one line about not caring about how a bill like that would affect a large crop of people who would support him in votes, in debates and even NOW was so callous. Now I understand why former President Obama said she'd never run for president. I certainly wouldn't vote for someone who would dismiss the significance of that bill. I 100% get the motherhood angle. But if you married who you married, you've got to be ready for a person who pays attention to people outside his home.I didn't finish the book. If she can't find it in her heart to care about significant laws like that, then I can't find it in my heart to care about the rest of the words in the book. I drove by the nearest library to donate the book and kept it moving.

  I have always liked, respected, and admired Michelle Obama. Her grace, intelligence, commitment to her husband and children, has been inspiring. I had some idea about her background, and the President’s, but she made it come alive in this book. I am glad of her candor, her glimpses into their home life, her dedication to,doing what is right, her persistence in staying true to herself, despite all obstacles. I am also glad of the forthright way she paints the picture of what being a black woman in America is actually like, and the need for cross cultural understanding in this country. We shouldn’t marginalize anyone, all it takes is a little encouragement, persistence, and engagement from all of us. A wonderful read by a remarkable woman.

  I felt like I knew most of what was in the book through headlines and whatever else. It was really about the plot of her life rather than larger defining moments. I did enjoy reading more about her upbringing. There was alot that I did not know there. But, I felt overall like she definitely was too careful with her words (regarding racism, oppression). Also, the feminist in me felt sad/unfulfilled that she seemed to put her career and plans on hold a number of times so that Obama could run for various offices. Overall, this book was just ok but boring. Maybe others would like it but I really wanted more.

  I remember the first time I even remotely let myself believe that Barack and Michelle Obama could take residence in the White House. It was when I saw a photo of them flanked by Malia and Sasha in Ebony magazine. It was a beautiful photo wherein the first family were donning winter coats, their faces lit up with hopeful smiles. Could it happen? Would it happen? Do I dare let myself believe the unthinkable? I recollected being a child and seeing the walls plastered with the presidents of the United States—all white men. Who was this black man who had the audacity to believe he could become the leader of the most powerful nation in the world? Moreover, who was that beautiful black woman standing at his side and how did she get there? I, like many others, had never heard of Barack or Michelle. It seemed like a dream, like they had appeared out of nowhere. Who are these people?Well, it’s been a decade since I came across that photo in Ebony Magazine and that unfamiliar family as we all know became the first black First Family. Over the years I’ve learned a lot about these people, but it wasn’t until I read Michelle’s memoirs BECOMING that I came to truly appreciate this family and all they’ve sacrificed to reach the heights that they have. Michelle, starting with the preface, pulled me right in, capturing my imagination with her eloquent narrative. When I came to the paragraph in the preface where she said she had heard about the swampy parts of the internet that questioned everything about her, right down to whether she’s a woman or a man, I knew this memoir was going to not just be a read, but an experience. I knew in that moment that Michelle had poured her heart and soul into this book and after reading all 429 pages I was right.BECOMING is a breathtaking, world wind, masterpiece. Michelle takes us back to the South Side of Chicago where she was raised by her devoted parents and protected by her older brother Craig. Michelle wasn’t born with a silver spoon in her mouth, but she was surrounded with immediate and extended family who loved and nurtured her and who stressed the importance of getting an education and who exposed Michelle to arts and culture.Michelle’s writing is so descriptive and intimate that you feel like you’re sitting across from her while she flawlessly reveals her life story. I laughed out loud and sobbed throughout the book. There are so many poignant and heartfelt moments. When Michelle described Craig’s teenage preventive phase which included him having their father lay on the floor so that he could practice hauling him out of the house in case there was a fire, I couldn’t help but laugh. No, if a fire were to have broken out, it wouldn’t have been a funny matter, but the way Michelle described the incredulous look on their father’s face, it provoked much laughter. Michelle’s father suffered with multiple sclerosis and it grew worst over time. She made me cry at her first recital when she became paralyzed at the sight of the perfect grand piano in front of her. She was used to playing on her Aunt Robbie’s upright with the broken keys. Aunt Robbie came to the rescue and placed Michelle’s finger on the middle C so that she could play.Michelle keeps you turning the pages as she takes us from her early years into her high school years and on to college, a journey that is fraught with challenges and insecurities. “Am I good enough?” Yes, that was a constant refrain. Like many of us, Michelle had doubts, but she kept forging ahead, even when the counselor at Princeton told her that she didn’t think Michelle was Princeton material. Michelle proved that counselor wrong when she graduated from Princeton and joined a top Chicago law firm where she became Barack’s mentor.I thoroughly enjoyed reading about their first encounter and subsequent courtship. It was comforting to read that Barack and Michelle weren’t the perfect couple I fantasized they were. And I applauded Michelle for revealing that they had gone to marital counseling where Michelle and Barack came to realize that it was not either of their responsibility to make the other person happy. I was also surprised to learn of their fertility challenges. The more I read, the more I realized that Michelle is so like many of us, with flaws, dreams, struggles and a whole lot of determination. I got so swept up in reading BECOMING I would read until the wee hours of the morning. Yes, it’s that good.She gives a bird’s-eye view of life in the White House and what a view it is. Being waited on hand and foot, living in opulence. But she also writes about the downsides—living in a bubble, restricted movement, guarded, the dark side of politics and meanspirited politicians, trying to raise and protect her children. Whew! You have to have the nerves of steel to be a first lady and Michelle did it with grace and style. I also loved how she outlined all of Barack and her accomplishments during their time in the White House. I knew the obvious, like The Affordable Care Act and Michelle’s fight against childhood obesity, but they did so much more.I can go on and on. So many memories and stories, woven together so well that it will inspire you to want to do more, to look outside of yourself, to want to make a difference, to want to make an impact on the world in a positive and tangible way. BECOMING should be required national reading.Thank you, Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama for being enough. For BECOMING!

Michelle, starting with the preface, pulled me right in, capturing my imagination with her eloquent narrative. When I came to the paragraph in the preface where she said she had heard about the swampy parts of the internet that questioned everything about her, right down to whether she’s a woman or a man, I knew this memoir was going to not just be a read, but an experience. I knew in that moment that Michelle had poured her heart and soul into this book and after reading all 429 pages I was right.BECOMING is a breathtaking, world wind, masterpiece. Michelle takes us back to the South Side of Chicago where she was raised by her devoted parents and protected by her older brother Craig. Michelle wasn’t born with a silver spoon in her mouth, but she was surrounded with immediate and extended family who loved and nurtured her and who stressed the importance of getting an education and who exposed Michelle to arts and culture.Michelle’s writing is so descriptive and intimate that you feel like you’re sitting across from her while she flawlessly reveals her life story. I laughed out loud and sobbed throughout the book. There are so many poignant and heartfelt moments. When Michelle described Craig’s teenage preventive phase which included him having their father lay on the floor so that he could practice hauling him out of the house in case there was a fire, I couldn’t help but laugh. No, if a fire were to have broken out, it wouldn’t have been a funny matter, but the way Michelle described the incredulous look on their father’s face, it provoked much laughter. Michelle’s father suffered with multiple sclerosis and it grew worst over time. She made me cry at her first recital when she became paralyzed at the sight of the perfect grand piano in front of her. She was used to playing on her Aunt Robbie’s upright with the broken keys. Aunt Robbie came to the rescue and placed Michelle’s finger on the middle C so that she could play.Michelle keeps you turning the pages as she takes us from her early years into her high school years and on to college, a journey that is fraught with challenges and insecurities. “Am I good enough?” Yes, that was a constant refrain. Like many of us, Michelle had doubts, but she kept forging ahead, even when the counselor at Princeton told her that she didn’t think Michelle was Princeton material. Michelle proved that counselor wrong when she graduated from Princeton and joined a top Chicago law firm where she became Barack’s mentor.I thoroughly enjoyed reading about their first encounter and subsequent courtship. It was comforting to read that Barack and Michelle weren’t the perfect couple I fantasized they were. And I applauded Michelle for revealing that they had gone to marital counseling where Michelle and Barack came to realize that it was not either of their responsibility to make the other person happy. I was also surprised to learn of their fertility challenges. The more I read, the more I realized that Michelle is so like many of us, with flaws, dreams, struggles and a whole lot of determination. I got so swept up in reading BECOMING I would read until the wee hours of the morning. Yes, it’s that good.She gives a bird’s-eye view of life in the White House and what a view it is. Being waited on hand and foot, living in opulence. But she also writes about the downsides—living in a bubble, restricted movement, guarded, the dark side of politics and meanspirited politicians, trying to raise and protect her children. Whew! You have to have the nerves of steel to be a first lady and Michelle did it with grace and style. I also loved how she outlined all of Barack and her accomplishments during their time in the White House. I knew the obvious, like The Affordable Care Act and Michelle’s fight against childhood obesity, but they did so much more.I can go on and on. So many memories and stories, woven together so well that it will inspire you to want to do more, to look outside of yourself, to want to make a difference, to want to make an impact on the world in a positive and tangible way. BECOMING should be required national reading.Thank you, Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama for being enough. For BECOMING!

  You can get an unsigned copy of this book for much, much less money, so this review isn't really about the substance of the book, but more its presentation and whether it's worth all the extra money.  From a collector's standpoint, I think the book is definitely worth it, assuming an authentic signature.  One of the reviews here said the signature is ""autopen,"" which would essentially be a facsimile signature done by machine.  My understanding of autopen signatures is that they are all identical.  My copy's signature is definitely different than the signature shown in the stock photos, so I don't have reason to doubt its authenticity.  The book is presented in a gorgeous presentation box, with bonus prints on sturdy cardstock that you can frame if you want.  I collect signed books and think this is a valuable addition to my collection. It really is a beautiful book!

  I felt like Ms. Obama held back in so many ways...her voice, stories, insider scoop, racism experiences, sexism experiences...everything. Perhaps she feels/felt the need to protect her husband's legacy -- to appear perfect yet again (a pressure she talks about in the book). But it makes the memoir feel artificial. Also, for someone who comes across as an intellectual, this narrative was far from deep. I've been impressed by her in the past, so I was surprised by the lack of gravitas to her memoir. Sadly, I cannot recommend this book.

  I was so excited to read this book after all of the reviews and the positive press the book was receiving.  Before I read this I really didn't believe that Michelle was so racist.  I have heard that about her but didn't believe it was true until I read this.  I do believe that the book was honest and written from her heart.  I also believe that it was written to inspire young black women, which is a good thing.  However, after reading this I do believe Ms. Obama doesn't appreciate that many, many white people voted for her husband and many, many white people have helped African Americans along the road to equality.  I feel a little let down that she did so much to help the black community but the feel of the book was that she didn't give a hoot about white people because they are all of priviledge.  That is too bad.  As much as I have been taught there is richness in diversity, I think the Obamas are missing that.  Sad but true.  I never knew that about the Obama's even though I have heard many people say it.  It wouldn't have changed my vote because they did so much good for this country but maybe they did help get Trump elected.

  From humble beginnings the book leads you through the driven life of Michelle Obama and her continued exploration on how to use her talents to do good.  Best parts of the book were those moments once the Presidency was won and her feelings of entering and living life in the White House.  She does a good job at immersing you into political life and how she carefully protected her daughters along the way.  At the heart of it she is figuring out her life as we all are.... with that quiet voice in her head saying “Yes you can” as doubts creep in.  Definitely a book worth a read that makes you long for days of old when the President of the United States was someone who didn’t make you cringe with every tweet.

  I don't want to be recognized as someone not supporting my AA sister & Former FLOTUS; however, I keep putting down this book for days/weeks at a time and only when I am completely bored with nothing else to do, I say, 'oh that book.' It is an average read. I enjoy how her feelings are expressed about family and family ties, and even her desire for non-profit work for which she is very practical about making a living from... But it feels like it is a loosely-joined memoir of an average citizen. And maybe that's okay because she is commonly viewed as the FLOTUS of the people. From a literary viewpoint, it isn't an enjoyable read. From a historical viewpoint, the book is a must have. I thoroughly enjoy her public speeches because she has good common sense and her message is relatable to the topic for which she appears to speak.I just don't have that drive to never put it down or skip an activity because this book is my life right now. Over 80% of books I read are that incredible read for me. Then there's the 20% of ""Meh, at least I finished it.""I haven't finished Becoming yet. Some day I will. Maybe my expectations are too high and unrealistic or maybe I need to attend the intimate talk to understand the backstory to this book...I am conflicted.WAIT!!! The author is a developing writer. I have now completed about 60% of the book and I enjoyed it! I can still put it down, but I've been planning undivided-attention time because she has captured her audience in me. My suggestion...KEEP READING-- it gets better. Yaay!!!

  This is both a fascinating and moving account of First Lady Michelle Obama's life, starting with her childhood on the South side of Chicago and detailing her experience in the White House. As if I didn't already have a million reasons to admire this strong, graceful, hardworking woman, I now have a million more reasons. I wish I had a way to personally thank her, both for everything that she and her family have given for the sake of our country, and for sharing even more of herself in this book.

  I bought this book for my wife, but read it also out of curiosity.  Michelle's memoir is well-written and remarkably candid.  She covers her entire life, using well chosen memories from her childhood, life away from home as a college student, and early law career leading up to of course to meeting Barack Obama.  How these two very different personalities came together and created a strong marriage is the core story.  Michelle is very honest about their ups and downs as a couple, providing insights which should be valuable to others.  Barack's later life in politics is discussed more from the perspective of the impacts (both humorous and threatening) on their family life.  Thus, this is not a book of political analysis, which I found refreshing.  Michelle's wry sense of humor and optimism about human nature consistently shine through this narrative, and offer a message of hope both on a personal and national level.

  I hate to be so gossip-oriented, but ""Becoming"" answered many questions I had pondered, but politely kept to myself. Like, did they live together before marriage? What did Michelle's family think about that? And were Barack and Michelle really so practical that they intentionally waited to have children?? I was somehow relieved to find out how human they are. It is clearly a blessing that Barack found Michelle early on in his life. Much of his success is rooted in the solid foundation that Michelle created for him and the family.

  Michelle Obama is surprisingly candid about some part of her life, especially about her marriage. The book is not as detailed as I had hoped for. Early parts of her life are more detailed. Her story would be inspiring for many. Growing up in poor household, ending up going to Princeton and Harvard, is what makes her so interesting. Book is a good read if you are interested in Michelle Obama’s life before she became First Lady, parts after she became First Lady or not detailed. She doesn’t talk much about politics or policy during her husband’s presidency. Perhaps rightly so, she’s focused on her priorities—healthy diet etc.

It’s a true American tale, from the struggles of making ends meet, to living inside that house (in her case the ultimate,  THE WHITE HOUSE) with the white picket fence. I understood her struggles, her pain and her joy. I also enjoyed reading about our former president in his early years. I see now how he became president. Obama just believed in the American people and our ability to change for the better. I truly appreciate how Mrs. Obama was open about her struggle with conceiving and she ultimately decided on invitro fertilization.  I am a certified nurse midwife and encounter many women with the same problem. Thank you Mrs. Obama for telling women that it is alright to conceive a child this way. I enjoyed reading the book so much, I also purchased the audio version and hearing Mrs. Obama voice tell her story is priceless.

  Highlights for meShe suffers from imposter syndrome too. In chapter 5 and throughout the book she recognizes that she works hard for her accomplishments but there is a voice inside her head at times asking ‘Am I good enough?’She struggled with infertility like many women. In chapter 13 ‘It turns out that even two committed go-getters with a deep love and a robust work ethic can’t will themselves into being pregnant. Fertility is not something you conquer.’She wants to increase awareness for miscarriage and help shatter the stigma of shame. In chapter 13 ‘If I were to start a file on things nobody tells you about until you’re right in the thick of them, I might begin with miscarriages. A miscarriage is lonely, painful, and demoralizing almost on a cellular level. When you have one, you will likely mistake for a personal failure, which it is not.’As a woman, she bares the burden of infertility treatments while her husband went about his daily life. ‘I was just feeling the acute burden of being female…None of this was his fault, but it wasn’t equal, either, and for any woman who lives by the mantra that equality is important, this can be a little confusing. It was me who’d alter everything, putting my passions and career dreams on hold, to fulfill this piece of our dream.’I finish the book wanting more. She touched on so many themes and thoughts that are my own and I loved hearing her perspective on work/life balance, imposter syndrome, bullying, infertility, friendship, mom guilt.

  I have read thousands of books in my life (I'm 86) but seldom have I been captivated so much. I am not a US citizen, I am also a white male. I read this book because I thought it might be interesting to get a view from someone who, in her own words , are ""others"" in a position about as high as you can get in this world. Yes, it is very interesting but much more, it is inspirational without ever preaching. As a bonus , it is a very well written and nice book. Highly recommended, especially for the young people setting their first steps on the way to becoming.

  Let me first say that I don't usually read autobiographies.  I respect and believe in Michelle Obama and miss the class, dignity and brilliance she brought to the White House.  I picked up the book with the intention of just reading the jacket and began the first few pages and was suddenly 100 pages in...  She brings you along on the journey of her life as if you were there with her and her memories of events, moments and snapshots of her journey are salient.  Michelle Obama is such talented raconteur.  I would highly recommend this book!!!

  I did not vote for Obama because I thought McCain and Romney more qualified by virtue of experience.  Obama is, however, a gentleman and a scholar, and as I write this (2019) I'd love to see him back in office.  As far as Michelle goes, I considered her necessary baggage (like Melania) but was very interested in learning more about her.  I learned that she was very accomplished and committed, with or without Barack.  Yet she is far too focused on 'things black'—which is fine for Michelle as person, but not so fine as Michelle First Lady.  Complaints about black people getting short shrift in life are valid, but I wonder if she really would have made it to Princeton and Harvard without a quota system in place.  (Strangely absent from the book is any discussion at all about her years at Harvard.)  Her complaints about Republicans and right-wingers going after her husband the president are disingenuous in the light of current efforts to discredit and even unseat Trump.  (I personally dislike both of these efforts.)  Strange also is the lack of comment on Malia's WHITE boyfriend(s), given the emphasis throughout the book on the daughters and their well-being.  Some of the tidbits of life in the White House were very interesting to me, although at times I fear she doth protest too much.  She had no problem commissioning a china setting, or spending thousands on a vegetable garden, or going on a dinner date to New York City.  She seemed quite satisfied having all of those black servants at her beck and call, while at the same time mentioning the hurdles that black folks face.  The book, however, is well-written although not fully honest by virtue of suspected omissions.  Thus three stars.

My only problem was all the detail she went into about so many aspects of her life and events that happened in her life.  There’s only so much I want to read about your home on Euclid Avenue and events that took place in her life along way.I love that she was honest, at least to a point, when talking about her relationship with Barack.  I found myself flipping pages a lot  though, and I don’t usually do that. That’s how long some of the stories were. She did talk some about leaving the White House and her feelings about Trump , and that part was interesting and satisfying. I think I just started to run out of gas with all the stories.  I still love her though.

  I read early reviews which announce that Michelle Obama hates politics, (which I don't think is true, she does just not respect it or enjoy it all that much) and that she used IVF to conceive her two daughters, that she and Barack had marriage problems and sought a counselor  But this is mainly gossip and ignores that this book is an insightful, well written, and honest memoir of a young woman who grew up black in South Chicago, that she was loved, and is clearly capable of courage, love, loyalty and honesty, and that she has her own gifts that  would have made her a woman of great value if she had never met Barack Obama.  She is introspective but never self obsessed, a difficult accomplishment in a memoir, she made choices throughout her path to being First Lady, and worked very hard to help disadvantaged and overlooked youth, especially young girls, she keeps her friends for a lifetime, she sets her own path and then plans how to achieve her objective, and while she is a highly educated career woman and Harvard lawyer and University of Chicago Medical Center vice president, she remains a devoted mother and wife.  If you want to learn how to have it all, she will be the first to say you can't, but you can decide where the compromises can be found to have a lot of whatever you truly need.  I loved this book.

  The book itself is beautiful, filled with photos in color showing the chronology of her remarkable life.  One cannot help but appreciate her intellect, forthright perceptions and dedication to her family and our country.  Michelle's vulnerability as black child, black young woman and First Lady is a prominent spectacle of our society.  There are small incidents that stand out as a child for herself and her brother.  It is a sorry reflection of our society, but Michelle (with Barak) changed our history.  Their civility and parenting is a remarkable example.Her descriptions of her childhood are meticulous.  She recalls her home on the second floor of a relative's house.  Her parents are portrayed as quiet, hard-working people who provided a stable environment for their two children. We have front row seats watching Michelle emerge from a hard-driving child (she needed to be perfect) to a presence in her community.  Despite that this book is filled with specifics, I felt she wisely held back some of her feelings when she became an adult.Michelle works with hope, not anger.  Although her anger is evident in this memoir, it is tempered with her love and need to hope.  She does reveal, with frankness, her fears and her reference to Trump's lies and its impact is no small thing.  We were very lucky to have the Obamas representing our nation.  They continue to set a standard of behavior.  This book is another example of our evolving nation and Michelle's contribution. Read this honest, forthright autobiography. It is inspiring.

  I read a lot, a ton of biographies. This one held my attention quite well.I enjoyed the story of her childhood and early years. There was an emphasis on the adults who shaped her, as there should be. Then a fascinating glimpse into the life of the Obamas. Their meeting, dating years, the unique proposal, and the marriage. The philosophy behind their public service.It was interesting to learn the backstory of her nutrition initiatives for children. She thought she was serving healthy foods to her kids, but her pediatrician told her they were starting to gain too much weight from frequent takeout and certain commonly used lunch items. She changed their diet and saw improvement at the next checkup.I especially love the little details of daily life that she provides. They went to a certain restaurant, and always got the pot roast, the brussel sprouts and the potatoes.There are parts that go into a little more detail than I needed, but overall I found the book charming and memorable. All the major moments from the Obama tenure are mentioned here and her point of view was enlightening.The woman is still clearly in love with her husband, and if he has any flaws, we won't learn them from her.She is proud of herself, and her accomplishments. She should be.Most of the one star ""reviews"" apparently did not read the book.

  I'm on Chapter 17. I adore Michelle Obama and respect her a great deal. But do I really have to spend pages to find out what her friends liked to wear? We spend chapters on her childhood and then bingo bango, she's married, has kids, and is on the campaign trail. Huh? After wading through all of this stuff, I wanted the book to be more consistent. I wanted the pace to be faster and not dwell on every little detail, which seemed to bog the book down. Some of that is great, but the extent to which the book seems to be at a standstill makes it hard to get through the entire book. And it is a hefty book. I want to know more about what she accomplished on her job during her early marriage, how she balanced her career with motherhood, how she made the decisions she did.  To me, Michelle Obama has a head on her shoulders. I don't think this book needed to be this length. About half of the material on her childhood could have been cut without harming the book.

Some of that is great, but the extent to which the book seems to be at a standstill makes it hard to get through the entire book. And it is a hefty book. I want to know more about what she accomplished on her job during her early marriage, how she balanced her career with motherhood, how she made the decisions she did.  To me, Michelle Obama has a head on her shoulders. I don't think this book needed to be this length. About half of the material on her childhood could have been cut without harming the book.

  I bought this as an audible book. It is narrated by Michelle Obama and to have this great person in my ear on my daily walks was incredible. A really good story that everyone should read. The strong foundation that built up this tremendous woman is both inspiring and heartwarming. A real-life filled with ups and downs and heartbreak and strength. A must-read for anyone who wants to know more about this impressive person. Liked her before, love her even more now!

  I really enjoyed hearing Michelle's story from her personal point of view. I did find some of the time lapses to have odd gaps, but it didn't effect the overall flow of the story too much. She is definitely quite the inspiration, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to find their own path, or simply to those who appreciate the Obama's as much as I do.

  The only dissonance I have with this memoir is the cover photo, but the only cover photo I can visualize as working better is the official painting of her as First Lady. I wonder what her thinking was in using it. Was she persuaded to use it or did she wish to use it? Is her desire to becoming more to be this unbelievably glamourous icon? I think the cover does a disservice to her and to her message. For it is a message memoir--and a worthy one. She accepts that she is a role model, and she wishes to encourage any person--especially young girls--to not give up but to continue striving to reach their goals and to deal with the world as it is.I liked that she divided her story into three parts: Becoming Me, Becoming Us, and Becoming More. I liked that she avoided politics and was forthright in claiming her story and encouraging her readers to claim their stories. I liked that she was generous in thanking her teams who worked with her in campaigns, who worked with her in the White House, and who worked with her in writing this book and putting together the details and facts that give it heft. Although I noted that she was sometimes repetitive, I was always glad to be reminded of whatever point she was recalling.Obama writes well, and I hope she writes more books.

  A few of my friends and relatives (very few) who have NOT read Michelle Obama’s book have asked me if it’s worth buying. How many ways can I say “Yes?” Hell yes! Absolutely! Without question!With four of the 24 chapters remaining, I am nearly finished reading “Becoming.” To say that the book is a page-turner is an understatement. I started out reading it like some folks dive into a box of chocolates. Now I’ve slowed my pace because I don’t want the book to end.I am a crier. I admit it. Sad movies. Sad songs. Sad things, in general, make me cry. I also turn on the waterworks when I’m happy. There are things in this book that made me shed sad tears, but there are numerous disclosures that produced happy blubbering.It is NOT a book about politics, though political involvements are inadvertently part of her story. Michelle reiterates numerous times that she did not want or pursue a life in the political arena, but she fell in love and married a man who brought her with him into the limelight.Michelle is honest and inspiration when she talks about growing up poor and black on the South Side of Chicago; about graduating from Princeton and Harvard Law Schools and pondering the decision to give up career choices that she enjoyed in return for getting married and later struggling to maintain that marriage. She talks about motherhood, her miscarriage and finally birthing two beautiful daughters.If you ever wondered, as I often have, what happens behind the scene when a married couple gets on the campaign trail, she lays it all out there for you. The good, the bad, the challenging, and the ugly experiences of becoming a public figure. Michelle exemplifies her motivational mantra, “When they go low, we go high.”“Becoming” is a powerful book. It is inspirational to anyone who reads it, but it is a gift especially to Black women who often feel that we are frequently unfairly portrayed as the angry black woman. You will draw fortitude from this book. The former First Lady is intelligent, funny, and can write her a** off. I’ve read a lot of books, and this is the BEST one I’ve read in a long time.

  Michelle Obama is a surprisingly good writer. Her initial autobiography, which takes up about half the book, is a great read, and she is especially moving in talking about loss - the loss of her father to ALS, the loss of a dear friend to cancer. She is also excellent at describing what it is to be Black and gifted in America, even under the best of circumstances - a loving nuclear family, relative economic security. And it's good at describing her meeting and falling in love with Obama. Then something not so great happens. This resilient, strong, self-sufficient woman becomes, apparently, everything she'd sworn not to become -- a satellite orbiting around her husband. The more the book goes on into the Obama presidential candidacy and win, the more the book becomes a paean to Obama. Lots of hints are given about discord - fights, tensions, buried and surfacing disappointments and anger. But how (and why) these get resolved so that everything is A-OK is unconvincing for me. And what of Obama's acceptance of millions of dollars of money from big banks, which financed much if not most of his campaign? This went against everything Michelle said he'd been for, an overall stance against such patronage. What about Obama's war-mongering? His deportation of immigrants and their children? His refusal to criticise the Bush/Cheney regime? Could it be that Obama also received oil and gas money, despite the fact of his taking a stand against fracking? We learn nothing about any of this in what started as a promising book but ends up being the usual heroics the US media now surrounds Obama with.

  Many of us feel like we truly know Barack and Michelle Obama from their eight years in the White House. We grew to appreciate and love them both. But in this memoir, this treasure, Becoming, Michelle Obama not only relates her life but manages to inspire and show us that she and her famous husband are full, rich, mostly ordinary folks. Michelle lets us know how passionate she is about the welfare of kids, especially her own. She gives details of her accomplishments in that arena as FLOTUS, First Lady of the United States. But she makes it clear that her primary focus is being a good mother, good daughter, and good wife. Note that good mother is the first thing I listed here, for she is, above all else, dedicated to her girls. Her main objective as a mother in the White House was to see that her daughters led as normal and as spontaneous lives as possible in that fishbowl with all America looking in. With clarity, structure, and fine writing, Michelle Obama tells her story, from growing up in a middle class African American family on the south side of Chicago, where love abounded, common sense was instilled, and education stressed, to her becoming a lawyer, a public servant, a wife, a mother, and the First Lady. She did it all cheerfully, finding ingenious ways to tamp down stress, have a career, and raise her girls whose father was absent some of the time because of his political ambitions. In Becoming, she tells sometimes funny, sometimes heart-wrenching anecdotes of her meetings with famous figures, wounded soldiers, young people, and mothers who lost their children to violence. She also makes it very clear that she hates politics. She did a lot of politicking to support her ambitious, brilliant, and beloved husband. But she, herself, is glad she is “out of the game” except for an occasional stump speech. And surprisingly, she lets us know that this man she adores has his own warts. The Obama we know as a public figure and love as a down-to-earth but somewhat god-like figure does indeed suffer some human traits that drive his wife up against the wall! And that’s what makes this book so wonderful. I read Barbara Bush’s autobiography, and although I still think of her a gracious, great lady, her long-winded, mostly gushing accounts of everyone she ever met made for a sluggish, often boring book. But Becoming is lively. Michelle Obama is brilliant, wise, educated, a talented writer, and her book is indeed a treasure—as is she.

  She let us in. Decade by decade, she lays it out. She’s just like all of us. You will get to know her better than you know even your closest friends. It’s captivating and enlightening. Her childhood in Chicago and young adult life at Princeton and Harvard were filled with family, friendship, loss, love, community, dignity, ambition, laughter, and great memories for us all to enjoy. She painted the pictures so well. I loved her stories about Barack Obama and her mother. I learned quite a bit about POTUS. What a well-written, first-class memoir!Going doing in history as the best FLOTUS ever, mainly because she had a full 8 years to engineer so many initiatives and touch so many lives and also because she is still young and motivated. She has many more years of impact, including her initiatives—Let’s Move!, Reach Higher, Let Girls Learn, and Joining Forces. The day she and President Obama left the White House, forty-five million kids were eating healthier breakfasts and lunches; eleven million students were getting sixty minutes of physical activity every day through our Let’s Move! Active Schools program. Through Joining Forces, they’d helped persuade businesses to hire or train more than 1.5 million veterans and military spouses. On education, she and Barack had leveraged billions of dollars to help girls around the world get the schooling they deserve. More than twenty-eight hundred Peace Corps volunteers were now trained to implement programs for girls internationally. And in the United States, she had helped more young people sign up for federal student aid, supported school counselors, and elevated College Signing Day to a national level.All this and they managed two terms in office without a major scandal. They held themselves and the people who worked with them to the highest standards of ethics and decency.I must add that I was a tad set back regarding her comments regarding her speech stating ‘she was proud of her country for the first time as an adult’ and of comments about Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Obama seems to not take accountability for this statement, seemingly backpedaling and blaming the media. I was hoping she would own up to it. When your great-grandparents come to America greeted with ease, new opportunities and wealth creation, you are very proud of America. However, when your great-grandparents come to America greeted with chattel slavery, family separation, and murder, well, the proudness is a ""stretch goal"". This should be understandable for all those who know true American history. It adds context of the shameful history of black people in this country. Juxtapose this with the Rev. Wright headlines and it's like crying foul on one move and chastising someone else (Rev. Wright) for a similar move. She wrote that, “Barack and I were dismayed to see this, a reflection of the worst and most paranoid parts of the man who’d married us…”. Obama's extreme judgment on Rev Wright's ""spitfire"" preaching, and ""narrow-mindedness"" seamed very dismissive. She recognizes that this is the mindset of those who'd come of age in a time of segregation, yet used language such as ""absurd"" and vitriol"" to him. When her senior thesis was discovered as to be a black power manifesto, however, she called it ""small-minded"" and ""ludicrous"" of the media. She said she was young and naïve. They listened to scores of his sermons throughout the 1990s, yet it's not until 2008 that they are appalled. They distanced themselves for political reasons in 2008 from the man and continue the same narrative and direction. This was, as I believe, to pave the path for their standards of decency. I concluded that her perspective has evolved at a level that none of us will fully understand. She’s sat in kitchens of Iowans, had adorable conversations with the Queen of England and has heard stories of tens of thousands of everyday people. I put this all in perspective...no doubt, and love her like a big sister nonetheless.Her experiences at 54 are incredibly rich, like none other, and we should all be wholly inspired by this memoir.

  I absolutely loved this book.  It was so well written and it just flowed.  It was written almost like a novel and I didn't want to put it down .  I had a feeling Mrs. Obama was a very real, down-to-earth person, and this book confirmed it.  It was a story about how she grew up, her family and how they helped her to become who she is.  She talked about her marriage to Barack Obama, how she met him and how they got through early marriage, his running for office and the presidency.  It also confirmed what I thought about President Obama.  I always felt like he was a sincere, caring person and this book convinced me I was right.  I think they are both caring, sincere people and really wanted, and still want, what is best for the nation.  I know there is probably some bias in the book, regarding the division of the nation and other problems when Obama was president, but I also believe Mrs. Obama told the truth about those issues.  I just loved the way she came across, which was very warm and caring.  It just made me love her all the more!

  What a marvelous memoir. Michelle Obama sits us down before her remarkable life and shares her story with honesty, reflection, common sense, great advice and, most of all, with hope. An amazing achievement, her book gives a close-up, inside look at her climb from working-class obscurity on Chicago's south side to the relentless glaring spotlight of White House fame. Helping readers understand the dynamics of her family -- including her relationship with her husband Barack Obama and her daughters, Malia and Sasha -- Michelle Obama never lashes out at their political opponents or at her critics. Instead, her book is an example of how to go high when others go low. Rise above the cynics and criticism by working hard to do good for the world. Inspiring and encouraging. I wasn't planning to read Becoming, but I am SO glad I did! Five stars. Highly recommended!

  I have loved Michelle and Barack Obama for years now, and was looking forward to her book. As soon as you start to read the preface, you feel like you are having an intimate conversation with Michelle. The book is so genuine, so raw, so well written, that it reinforced for me how utterly remarkable she and her husband are, and how utterly fortunate we were to have them as our president and First Lady. Yes, reading her book made current events all the more painful in a way. But it also salved my wounds a bit, to have this personal conversation with her through her book.

  I bought the audible book, which she narrated. I salivated through the entire story. Her upbringing, the strength of her parents, how they dealt with racism and her father's illness, her love story with Barack which continues today. Hearing about their life as Barack continued his political/social work and what it was like as FLOTUS, raising and protecting their daughters, learning more about their White House years. They have always been a team, they are a love story everyone hopes to have. I could listen to this book over and over. She is an inspiration, as is her husband. Brava!!!!!

  Four stars may imply that this book is just so-so, but that isn't what I mean; it's actually very impressive indeed.  However, to me, a five-star book means it's really something extraordinary, and I just can't quite get there.Michelle Obama writes quite nicely -- the book engages in candid, plain speaking that is incredibly refreshing, particularly for someone who had to be so politically correct for so long.  I was impressed that she shared some intimate details of her life, from getting her period to the difficulty she and her husband had conceiving a child; not every First Lady would share those details.  She is also candid about her reluctance and fears about her husband's political career and why she opted to go along with it.  Again, not everyone would be so candid, and it's nice to see her affection for him throughout the book (BTW -- I never felt that was insincere in any way).So why ""only"" four stars?  Well, for one thing it glosses over a great deal of what she did as First Lady.  That may be inevitable -- the alternative would be to write a 900-page book.  But there's a sense of ""then I did this, then I did that"" that gets a bit repetitive if not tedious at times.  I also would have liked some more discussion of her life post-White House; she makes her views about Trump pretty clear (and they're not surprising at all), but it would have been nice to know what she's doing now.Still, four stars is a pretty good rating when you think about it. And the book demonstrates that there is a reason why she was such a popular First Lady

  Usually the public demands on the First Lady of the United States are minimal.  However, we live in times where division is rife and the public are starving for inspiration.  It’s a way of saying, “It’s all going to turn out right or at least as close as possible to right.”  So what is usually such a formidable demand on the President also attached to the First Lady.  Michelle Obama’s memoirs address many aspects of the goals that are expected of public figures.  Will all readers agree with the phases of her life that she describes in becoming me, becoming us, becoming more and the epilogue?  Probably not, but what a fine way to start understanding the ins and outs of the woman who became First Lady for eight years which clearly parallels the mental and emotional journey of America over those eight years of her service.First, First Lady Obama takes readers into the formation of her educational journey and the establishment of a personality grounded in honesty, integrity and purpose.  She admirably describes her ascent from insecurity step-by-step.  Molded by a hard-working family and meeting the challenges of a father who was ill for many of her growing-up years and of living in a family of limited economic means, she accepted thrift but also accepted a sense of responsibility about handling finances.  Hard work was the journey she was to take to rise from those conditions, encouraged by her parents’ model and life experience.It would be accurate to describe her education as “driven.” She was hungry to learn and that passion honored her drive with success.  Only after she wrestled through her college and legal education did she finally realize that her calling or passion was not to be law but in something connected to public service.  However, that separation was not as large as she seemed to experience.  That introductory period gave her an immense body of knowledge that she probably uses to this day.On and on the story continues.  The strengths and weaknesses of a marriage, campaigning for political offices, the expectations of supporters and the hellish harangues of opponents, all in all an evolution of skills and learning how to handle the public and private aspects of her entire life fill these pages of riveting expression, exposure and internal debate.Readers will love the light-hearted moments with the Obama children, the Secret Service and the friends and supporters of Michelle during each phase of her life, thoughts and responses to which every reader can relate.This is a memoir that should be must reading for all who deeply care about the future of our country and those who have prominence and influence over goals and dreams.  But more than that, this book is just as important about growing in becoming a life-affirming, honest, humorous, intelligent and deeply caring human being.  There’s much more herein – enjoy sharing Michelle Obama’s life story to date – it’s so real!

  “Let’s invite one another in. Maybe then we can begin to fear less, to make fewer wrong assumptions, to let go of the biases and stereotypes that unnecessarily divide us. Maybe we can better embrace the ways we are the same. It’s not about being perfect. It’s not about where you get yourself in the end. There’s power in allowing yourself to be known and heard, in owning your unique story, in using your authentic voice. And there’s grace in being willing to know and hear others. This, for me, is how we become.”What a truly fantastic memoir. You’re probably hearing that from everyone who’s read this book, and that’s for good reason. Its beautiful prose and thoughtful structure make it an easy yet powerful read.The book is broken into three parts: “Becoming Me,” “Becoming Us,” and “Becoming More.” “Becoming Me” chronicles Michelle’s childhood and family upbringing, from when she was very small until she was a young lawyer after grad school. “Becoming Us” follows Michelle and Barack’s relationship, marriage, and the presidency. And “Becoming More” goes from relatively recent events through the present.Every bit of this book was fascinating. I knew very little about Michelle’s family or upbringing other than that she grew up in Chicago, and now I know just how beautiful it was. I also knew little about the Obamas’ early marriage, and now I know that was beautiful as well. But those things were challenging too, and her transparency about them is poignant.All in all, this isn’t a memoir to be missed. It’s worth every bit of the praise it’s received, and I’m really glad that I got the hardcover to add to my shelves.

  This book is marvelous in all respects, as I expected.  But the honesty, the detail, the effort to inform is extraordinary.  What I most appreciated was the effort Mrs. Obama made to detail what she sought to accomplish while in the White House.  Her myriad efforts to lift up women, girls, poor people, students are so admirable.  I cannot imagine how much work went into hosting all the people, especially ordinary citizens and especially young people, that both she and her husband did, in addition to all their other duties.  Exposing people to the music, the cultures, just the mystique of the White House is such a wonderful and generous thing to do.  And to think that she did this kind of work while abroad also, especially in the English school for basically underprivileged girls.  To bring the same students and other groups of people back over and over, so that it was not just a one-time experience.  And then the efforts in the Garden!  It entailed so much work, and went on for the eight years she was there, becoming a really wonderful example.  And to think that now the Park Service tends it and no children are invited in, no learning about healthy foods--why that could not have been continued on some level?  It tells us a lot.  I am very grateful for this book and for Michelle Obama's exquisite and continual effort to stress that at the base of it all was the work of her beloved parents, equally beloved older brother and a host of relatives who showed her what love was and gave her such a solid foundation in becoming who she is today.  The title is well illustrated in this book and I think it is one of the best accounts of a truly impactful life that I have ever read.

  I am so glad that I followed the hype this time and bought Becoming. Mrs. Obama candidly revealed who she was by sharing stories from her childhood. Many of the stories actually are unremarkable and that is the point. I can imagine her family life,  a family like many that are the product of the Great Migration, her no nonsense mother, like so many from her generation,  and her father going to work everyday through physical challenges to give his family a better life.However, this memoir is an extraordinary story because this most ordinary girl became one of the most beloved figures in public life, and it was because she was a product of the humble, loving, and ordinary.I think this is her message, that young people, regardless of race, socio-economic, religion, address can excel given opportunities, encouragement, and love.Additionally, I really enjoyed reading about life within the White House. I chuckled at the escapes her mother and even Michelle (to Target) made from their bubble in the White House. It is amazing how she was able to provide a ""normal"" life for her daughters under the intrusive eye of the public and press. The Obama family's sacrifice to public service is so appreciated and the memoir made me realize what an incredible  sacrifice it was.Few books conjure up raw emotion in me. But while reading Becoming, I laughed, a got teary, and my heart fluttered.

Michelle Obama earned my deep respect when she first campaigned for her husband Barack in 2008. I cried buckets of tears watching the Obama family walk out after the election, with deep pride; thankful that I, an African American woman, lived to see people who looked like ME in the White House!The dignity and grace with which Michelle carried herself as First Lady made me even prouder to be a Black woman! Her passion for children, for education, for girls and women, for !military members and their families, put her even higher in my esteem.In reading BECOMIMG, you see the real Michelle Obama, honest and unfiltered; and she writes in such a unique way, you almost feel as if you're reading a letter or an email from one of your cherished friends!I loved this book!

  I wasn’t going to buy this book because autobiographies, I. My opinion, are usually really boring. However after watching a couple interviews Ms Obama did, I decided to buy the book. It arrived yesterday and this evening I finished it. I simply couldn’t put it down. Everyone probably knows the basics of her story but the insights she shares about her life were so very interesting. I kept thinking her “haters” should read the book - objectivity. This self driven child becomes a woman living within self (and societal) ascribed boundaries, she does all the “right” things and obtains her goal of working at a prestigious law firm. She matter of factly deals with white racism, privilege and just plain failure to ever attempt putting oneself in another’s shoes  (I was left wondering if her college roommates mother - after Ms Obama became Flotus - had regreted  having her daughter moved into a different room without a “black” roommate, but probably not.)  She meets a young man who grew up in an entirely different environment but who also succeeded in his endeavors and they marry. She finds herself living a life not even remotely like the one she had always envisioned but she had chosen it and embraced it. I love the truths she related throughout the book and those truths are why she has a legion of admirers including the Queen of England!  Read the book. Meet Michelle Obama!

  I wasn’t going to buy this book because autobiographies, I. My opinion, are usually really boring. However after watching a couple interviews Ms Obama did, I decided to buy the book. It arrived yesterday and this evening I finished it. I simply couldn’t put it down. Everyone probably knows the basics of her story but the insights she shares about her life were so very interesting. I kept thinking her “haters” should read the book - objectivity.

  Michelle Obama has given us a look into her life, from the time she was a little girl—right through to her current life as a former First Lady. She shares tales from her childhood, growing up on Chicago’s southside. She talks about places and events that give the reader a feel of the warmth and community that exist on the southside, a portrait that is very different than the popular characterization of the area as a bastion of crime and fear. As someone who grew up on Chicago’s southside and has chosen to return to the area to live, I must say—Michelle did a good job capturing the totality of the lifestyle.Reading the book is like sitting on a comfy couch with Michelle, having her talk to me about her life. It is well written and makes us feel as though we know the characters she introduces us to. College, politics, her romance and marriage to Barack, trials and triumphs of raising children in the White House, the personal attack’s she received as First Lady...she gives us entree to her life. I am nearly 2/3 into the book and I stopped reading it because I’m not quite ready for it to end. Thank you, Michelle Obama, for an excellent read and for making us proud.

  I wonder whether Michelle Obama or - as so many public figures prefer - a ghost writer wrote this (auto) biography?  It was beautifully written and I greatly enjoyed the choice of words and the language. If it was a ghost writer I'd love to know who as I would like to read more by this gifted writer.On the downside a few issues:i. I wish people who end up with such tremendous power would be more cosmopolitan. How about working in one or two countries outside the US before ascending to power?  How about speaking more than one language? Where is the openness and greater understanding of cultures outside one's narrow framework? This author has a very narrow framework, indeed!  Her entire childhood from birth to graduating from high school: Southside Chicago. She mentions one trip during high school to France.  Which leads me to the next point...ii. this person is not the most flexible, open-minded person. She strikes me as being extremely bourgeoise and middle-class.  Rigid, even. Not flexible. Unlike her husband who fortunately has lived in more than one culture. She always takes all the safe, 'right' steps. Avoids risk whenever possible. Works hard at getting good grades. Follows the rules. Goes to an Ivy League. Continues on to law school.  Never ever strays from the 'right' path.  It's not until she has worked at a leading (probably) law firm in Chicago (oops, she's back in her hometown.  How about getting a job in New York? Spread your wings a bit? You can still stay in the U.S.) that she realizes that the daily grind between papers is not all it was cut out to be (with the exception of the 'glamour' and the money that comes with this). And then she meets this maverick, half-white, half-black, intensely intellectual, deep-thinking, Hawaiian laid-back, through and through political creature who sweeps this very conventional woman off her feet.  He's everything she is not, except that he, too, has that stellar graduate credential. His non-conformity, his oh-so-not-ever-taking-the-safe-path is a huge contrast to how she is wired. And probably creates some intense tension. But we are not and need not be privy to this. Just because you are a public figure you are not required to share everything.iii. and if you get involved with a person whose entire being is 'public service' and is a politician through-and-through, yes, it's like having a competing wife in the relationship...someone who takes him away from you and the children, don't be miffed that you are not always number one. That just comes with the territory.  And she does not like it.iv. I cringed when she describes her visit to a mostly black school in which the studious kids have to fear for their safety JUST GETTING TO SCHOOL and despite her constant black and black perspectives (black=good; white.... meeew; how about some grey somewhere?), she has chosen to dedicate her time to growing a food garden in the White House and improving the health of obese kiddos around the U.S. ? Isn't the ability of a child of color to SURVIVE and pursue an education - especially if you have majored in African American studies and are so overly sensitive to skin color - so much more important than dedicating your White House years to teaching kids to be skinny and make sensible food choices? A fundamental right of EVERY child in the U.S. should be the ability to get a good education and that includes being safe on your passage from home to school and back.  Why on earth would you dedicate your energy to helping girls around the world get an education? Let's start with the home turf, please.  Every girl AND BOY in the U.S. should have the ability to get to school safely before you start raising a lot of money for girls outside the U.S.!  Isn't that the job of every head of state. Protect your own children first?v. The White House years are described as being so busy that she does not remember on a Friday what happened on a Monday. And yet apart from some cute stories with the Queen of England (did the editor tell her - honey, put that in the book, YOUR audience will LOVE it) Michelle Obama steers clear of any sort of political analysis.  This from a woman who kept harping about following her own career? Now that she is in the White House she has NO opinions? Or was the agreement to completely stay off the husband's turf as all of this will be covered in his book? I was disappointed that a person who has two degrees from top universities in the U.S. suddenly regresses into superficiality.Let's see. What else?vi. the story about 'escaping' from the security detail with one of her daughters to get out of the physical White House seems puerile. With great privilege come constraints. That's just part of the job. Sure it's no fun to be cooped up in a house, no matter how expansive this is. Did the editor urge the author to include this in the story? To make the protagonist seem more 'human'?  One reason this book sold over 10 million copies is because the author is a public figure. Being so well known has advantages and disadvantages.vii. a few other reviews have also touched on this. This (auto) biography is about me, I, me, I. Seems self-absorbed. She comes across much more likable in person during interviews than on paper.viii. and why so defensive? She is always trying to rectify any record that is critical of her. Just shrug it off. Who cares? She seems a bit insecure at times. As if she is still 'becoming'. As if she has not found her center and cemented it yet.  At 50 plus, I would expect her to know herself and be sure and confident with her own essence.ix. I was a bit taken aback by her refusal to 'forgive': ""I will NEVER forgive him (for harming my children or some such thing)."" I doubt that 'he' did or said anything on purpose to harm you (here the mamma bear comes out). I doubt he even thought about you when the whole Muslim controversy about 'Obama' came out (how can something as ridiculous as this even be taken seriously?). And in general the only person who is ultimately harmed is not the one who could be forgiven. It is the one who refuses to forgive.x. I had to laugh at the very oblique and gentle criticism of the female Clinton. She just was taking her time before declaring defeat to Obama in the anointment of the Democratic presidential candidate and this harmed the subsequent unity of the Democratic run. HRC did it again when she lost to Trump.  The female Clinton just does not like to lose, but that's another story...Anyway, just some thoughts. Yes, this is not your conventional review. Maybe because the book being reviewed seems so proper, sugar-coated and 'as expected'. And I still choose four stars as I loved the use of language. It was eloquent. The picture it portrayed of the protagonist - less so.She's had an incredibly privileged adulthood.  Now what?In case the reader of the review is wondering: we are of the same gender, age, and both have several university degrees.  I, too, was a minority growing up.

  I needed this book more than I could have imagined. I needed to be reminded that grace, wisdom and goodness can exist in politics. Michelle Obama’s voice is heard fully and with an honesty all too rare in America today. It is good to remember that there once was humanity and heart in the White House, and this book makes it just a little easier to believe that goodness might rise again, and that it only can rise if all of us, each of us, commits to goodness and decency in whatever way way can. I feel fortunate to have read this book and feel overwhelmingly grateful for the love and service the Obamas shared with this country.

  Eyes welled up at times, and chuckles escaped at other times ... This is a fantastic and incredibly honest and human story about the family, community, upbringing and life thus far, of an extraordinary lady - an extremely self-possessed and very complete woman with great integrity and honor - who just happened to very deservedly, become the historic first black First Lady of the United States. If you were looking for gossip, political score-settling, a hit piece, you certainly won’t find it in this excellent and well-done memoir of a brilliant, wise, witty, principled, disciplined, percipient, upstanding, unassuming, fun, serious, grounded, humble, gracious and incredibly generous and inspiring role model of a woman, who pulled herself up by the proverbial bootstraps - against all odds.She’s utterly refreshing! Upstanding and unaffected, consistently honorable, wise, percipient, unbeholden ...powerfully human in the most relatable and best of ways... She’s wife, mother, daughter, FLOTUS, woman, human, leader ...The best of the best... An awe-inspiring and completely inspiring and compelling role model who lives and walks her talk.. Wise, fair, honest ...she is the real deal..This is a woman of great depth and heart .. embodying a consistently lived humanity and caring for the least among us .. an authentic spirit and humanity that isn’t exploitative, self-aggrandizing, contrived .. or tied to self-elevation and scoring political brownie points .. In her memoir, she is gracious and generous - even to those who don’t deserve it.She in many ways continues to so proudly boost her husband; effusively and generously elevating him above herself, and positively validating and vouching for him in ways nobody else can. Her memoir at times reads like a loving tribute to her husband, her parents, and others who only ever gave her even the most cursory or marginal assistance..And even where I pegged her husband as a tad selfish/self-absorbed (and not nearly as protective or considerate of her, her needs, as he should and could have been), she instead takes the fall for him, excuses his selfishness away, and provides him cover again and again.. His ‘unusual’ upbringing and ‘ambitions’ seem to absolve him of his rather glaring shortcomings as a not so considerate and not always so protective husband..A magnificent, double Ivy League educated woman who is at once fun yet serious, down to earth, utterly unassuming, completely self-assured, unaffected and comfortable in her own skin.. In a world full of fickle, hollow, pretentious, contrived, beholden, cowardly, manufactured public figures, she stands out as that rare public figure that is not!I’ve bought several copies of this book, and will probably buy a few more copies as gifts.. I also listened to her fantastic and emotional Audible narration..This memoir sets the foundation for Mrs Obama’s life story as a whole, and covers just a sliver of her 8 years in the White House as America’s historic First Lady .. And as an incredibly fulfilling a read as it is, one gets the sense that she has at least 3 great books still left in her! I’d love to read more about her experience at Harvard Law in the 80’s and volunteering for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau; And I’d love her to write a more detailed first person account of her White House years. I’m dying to read her full and candid White House retrospective when she feels ready ... these must still feel like heady days - even more so than for those of us who don’t have the benefit of lived experience that she does..This memoir is so honest, offering up her story authentically - and not shying away from sharing honest mistakes that many of us would’ve easily skipped to avoid certain judgement. Even the photographs she includes in the book, and on her book tour, are authentic;  They aren’t posed or photo-shopped vanity images or empty faux-glamor shots re-done again and again, or taken from perfect and considered angles for that perfect vanity capture..Rather, they are unposed images that capture her normal and naturally lived life, her genuine interactions, and pertinent moments, and activities and events supporting some of her many important, substantive and impactful initiatives..But like the book, the pictures and her reflection on her motivations for her chosen projects and various initiatives as an executive and as First Lady, capture her effortless greatness, her depth of character, palpable humanity, undeniable grace, beautiful and fun spirit, her decency, genuine connection to a diversity of people, and a keen interest in and attentiveness to those without a voice, and that very real sense that not only is she fully engaged, she actually does care, and sees those who usually aren’t seen .. Her grace, powerful presence, natural beauty, dignity and humility is palpable.. as is her fierce sense of fairness and inclusivity ..of everyone, especially the marginalized, voiceless and least among us.. There is absolutely nothing phony or contrived about this rare gem of a marvelous, marvelous woman..Mrs Obama remains for me the very best thing about the 2-term historic presidency most decent, thinking people now miss..She’s self-possessed, clear-eyed, genuine, insightful, sincere, compelling, wise, principled, fun, whip-smart, unpretentious, disciplined, fearless, with integrity in spades..She absolutely deserves this long-overdue acknowledgment of her unassuming but positively impactful greatness and public presence - as evidenced by the success of her memoir and book tour.  It is heartening that she’s being deservedly recognized as brilliant, capable, formidable and fantastic in her own right, and celebrated and well-received not just in America, but the world over - And all in spite of the Alt-Right and other vicious naysayers who’ve viciously maligned and mercilessly dehumanized her for 10 years and counting, and continue to obsess over her, looking to thwart her and her success - and the fact that she’s still standing and soaring, despite their best and continued malevolent efforts to break her, tear her down.I am glad that this wonderful memoir, her first documentation of her life story, begins the introduction for so many, into understanding the true historic and cultural importance of this phenomenal woman and historic first black FLOTUS ..A worthy introductory documentation for posterity, of an unassumingly great woman and historic FLOTUS..

  I purchased Becoming because I enjoy reading the personal accounts of First Ladies. There were interesting passages in the book but for the most part I felt Michelle was at the right place at the right time and that her life didn't seem to have much focus until she met her husband. She didn't enjoy being an attorney. She admits that she was box checking throughout much of her life. Michelle Obama ended up marrying someone on a distinctive path and it was nice reading about her courtship with Barack Obama etc. But I wasn't bowled over. The last couple of chapters were rather repetitive and she really didn't experience the racism and hardships that many people of color experience. I felt as a woman of color that Michelle was mostly lucky and that's great but as a person I don't find her humble. I find her to be a woman wrapped in good fortune and somehow the book was only ok.

  As a person who lives in a small island nation at the bottom of the Pacific but has visited the USA a couple of times in the previous millennium, I have always wondered how the Presidency worked.On television Michelle always looked fresh, and lively. Now I understand the amount of work that she had to do to make everything look that effortless.I am sorry that she is not wanting to stand for POTUS job in her own right. She is just the kind of person who should be running such a diverse country.She is a natural storyteller. I wish she lived in my country, I would be around to beg something from her garden just to chat with her.She is a national treasure and should be honoured for being able to bring up her daughters, provide support for Barack, who seems like quite nice bloke, nurture the projects for those that politics often ride rough-shod over and still look serene.Michelle you are my hero.Thank you for letting us all in.

  When I read this book, it reminded me of the book “The Wizard of Oz.”  An ordinary middle class person gets caught up in a whirlwind which leaves her a whole new better person after a trip through a strange land.Mrs. Obama had an unremarkable childhood with truly excellent parents.  Because of the good people in her life, because she worked hard and tried to be perfect, and because she is smarter than average, she got a sterling education.  She had envisioned a sort of “Father Knows Best” or “Leave it to Beaver” sort of life for herself, but hadn’t really found her own self when she met the handsome, brilliant, and idealistic Barack Obama.  The whole experience caught her in the tornado and left her a better woman and a shining light for a generation.She is keenly aware of her responsibility, but this isn’t a didactic book.  It is an entertaining romp through the weirdness of he special circumstance.  I cried a few times, but it is not a sad book.  Despite everything, she remains positive and hopeful.  I couldn’t put the book down.

  There is  nothing I disliked about this book.  It was entertaining, insightful, funny, sad and I would recommend this to anyone who loves all these attributes.  When she met Barack, it was NOT love at first sight, but as their friendship grew it was not because of blindly going into a relationship.  I must admit, I had a hard time putting it down for such mundane needs as preparing meals, or going to sleep at night.  Mrs. Obama doesn't sugarcoat her upbringing, or her very extended family, or her misgivings about her choice to become a lawyer.  She wasn't even sure about Barack, but she could see that this was an intelligent, thoughtful, and kind man and these were the first things that drew her to him.  He was messy, she color-coded her class notes; he smoked, she was shocked and hated smoke; he grew up in a free-spirited family, she grew up in a more traditional one.  But it worked out and we are the beneficiaries.I laughed out loud, and shed quiet tears, felt deep anger, and great hope.

  Was not impressed with this book at all!  I have read and enjoyed books telling of life in the White House through the years.  They have revealed interesting and unexpected happenings that us outsiders would never know.  This book spends more time telling how disappointed Michele was that the press covered what she wore that day.  When you are the First Lady and just part of the photo op there isn't much else to say.  The President is and should be the story maker. Sorry....too much complaining!

  Serious readers do not, I hope, expect that the memoirs of First Ladies will be filled with scandalous tidbits about life in the White House.""Becoming"" by Michelle Obama certainly isn't, and that is, I think, to her credit.Instead, this is a book that explains what it's like to grow up poor and succeed despite the odds. It's a book that explains what kinds of pressures Mrs. Obama faced as the wife of the first African-American President of the United States and how she - and he - coped with those stresses. It's a memoir that talks not only about successes but also about failures, about challenges that were met and those that were not.In short, it's everything that I could hope for in this kind of book.Mrs. Obama writes in a clear voice as she talks about growing up in Chicago in a small upstairs apartment, discusses her drive to become a lawyer and how, once she had attained that goal, found that it was not as satisfying as she had hoped. She also writes, in detail, about meeting the young Barack Obama and how he, without really seeming to try to do so, captured her heart. This, then, is a very personal book: It is not a book that delves into foreign policy, the global economy, her husband's influence on the world stage, or similar issues.It's because it is that kind of book that I enjoyed it so much. Historians and political scientists will discuss those issues over and over again. Some will proclaim Barack Obama one of America's greatest Presidents. Others will hold a contrary view. None, however, will be able to tell future readers about the personal lives of Michelle Obama and her husband, the personal stories about her childhood and the impact her father's degenerative illness had on her emotional well being. None will discuss - or be able to discuss - in any great detail the reasons she decided to leave the law and go into more socially relevant work. She alone can do that and, again in my opinion, she does it well.Just a side note: I personally believe that Mrs. Obama was one of America's greatest First Ladies because, like Eleanor Roosevelt and Jackie Kennedy - to name just two, she had an enormous impact on both domestic and foreign societies. Her sense of style, her grace under pressure, and her willingness to do so much more than simply host the odd White House dinner made the First Family accessible to Americans and the world in general in a way that few occupants of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue have been or will be now and in the future.If you want to know what motivated her to do that, read this book.

  Google top selling books for 2018 and you’ll see Michelle’s memoir. She’s been talking to Colbert, Ellen and Oprah about it. Amazon lists it for less than $20. Buy it. Read it. Then give it to someone else to enjoy.I admit her story was NOT what I expected. There’s a lot of heart in this memoir. One word: Poignant. I just finished Michelle Obama’s book Becoming. I knew how it would end and yet I had a hard time reading the final pages and Epilogue. I cried. Much like I had cried the night Barack won the Presidential election. I sobbed even harder the night, two years ago, when I realized that the Obama’s home was no longer 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I felt like I knew our First Family even though I had nothing in common with them. After spending several hours reading and thinking about what I had read, I realize I had NO idea about the intimate roles of President or First Lady. Michelle’s book reveals the hardship, the sacrifice and the strength of reigning from the highest office in our nation. It reveals integrity and beauty. Therein lies a solid foundation of respect. Most of all, her words describe an element of love. The kind of deep, unyielding love that one has for family, for dear friends and for our country. But there’s more. There are examples of love for strangers, for staff, for children. Yes, this book is about Michelle’s life. She grew up in Chicago in a small apartment with her parents and her brother Craig. They were and still are a close-knit unit. With Barack, there are tender memories shared. Some are downright funny; other memories require more than one Kleenex. She was a successful and productive business woman and I found her struggles as a new mother completely on point. She found ways to make it work. She also supported her husband’s political dreams without knowing what was next. Michelle worked long and hard at home and out on the campaign trail ever mindful of the girls’ needs. She persevered. Once Barack was President of the United States, her mission field reached far beyond DC and her programs have left a legacy that is genuinely heartwarming. With this book, Becoming, I have the distinct feeling that she is not finished. She is just beginning!One of my favorite passages, “You had only to look around at the faces in the room to know that despite their strengths these girls would need to work hard to be seen. There were girls in hijab, girls for whom English was a second language, girls whose skin made up every shade of brown. I knew they’d have to push back against the stereotypes that would get put on them, all the ways they’d be defined before they’d had a chance to define themselves. They’d need to fight the invisibility that comes with being poor, female, and of color. They’d have to work to find their voices and not be diminished, to keep themselves from getting beaten down. They would have to work just to learn.”**She goes on to describe a strong connection between them and herself – words of hope.

  This was a good read, and I like Michelle Obama for her ability to keep it real and inspirational for young women of the 21st century – and for not glossing over the challenges she faced along her journey with and without Barack Obama. I highly respect and admire the position she held as First Lady (and the first African American one at that). I believe she is genuine, has a strong work ethic, and is an excellent role model for professionalism and parenting. However, there were many Black women who came before her whose work is substantially, in my opinion, significant. For example, in 1973, Marian Wright Edelman founded the Children’s Defense Fund as a voice for poor children, children of color, and children with disabilities.  She was the first African American woman admitted to the Mississippi Bar. She graduated from Spelman College for Women and Yale Law School. Her father died when she was fourteen.  She was/is a phenomenal activist whose accomplishments/visibility were not, in part, due to the political attainment made by her husband.To that end, I am not one of the readers who “couldn’t put the book down” as I read about her accomplishments and goals. What moved me, and what she did well, was write about the passionate and endearing commitment of her parents to her and to her brother. Her father was the epitome of manhood. I felt as I had lost my father all over again when she wrote of his final days and of his passing. Even as Michelle ascended to the White House, her mother was there for her to assist in caring for her children.  A large segment of the population did not/does not have that level of support.  I am happy she took the time and space in the book to acknowledge her privileged upbringing - which had nothing to do with materialism. Well done!

  It was interesting to see this behind the scenes view of the Obama's rise to power and presidency from the point of view of his wife. It was definitely Michelle's story. Michelle seems like someone I would really like as a friend.I was shocked and rattled as many people were at the results of the 2016 election. So I could not help reading this book looking for clues as to why it went the way it did.Although Michelle was very inclusive in her view, she was very focused on women of color all over the world recognizing their self worth and achieving. She could see herself in these women.I had to wonder about the mostly blue collar white men who clearly felt that their needs were not addressed by this administration. I wondered about the drug ravaged rural areas that just seemed to get worse over those years. Weren't they the ones who spoke in their choice of someone who provided hope? And the concerns about illegal aliens living in this country which upset many of this group.Perhaps I will see more of these concerns addressed in Barack's book but I feel like we may have missed it. Barack Obama certainly was my favorite president and I was sad to see him go. But this election result did not come out of nowhere. It seems like in our enthusiasm to see the racial divide addressed, we missed something, something huge.

  I love the book and the writing. The problem is that I just recently started reading it, and now that I'm midway through it, starting with page 178, MANY pages have printing that is so light it is nearly impossible to read. Had I noticed earlier I'd have returned it for a new copy. Is there any chance that can still happen?

Not only will it be a struggle to read those pages, I was hoping to pass this wonderful story on to my sister for Christmas this year. Now it is a flawed gift, so it will remain sadly on my bookshelf, or tossed away. I am very disappointed and hope I can get a new copy.

Here are the pages with poor printing: 178,180,181,183,186,188,189,191,194,196,197,199,202,204,205,207!!! Not only will it be a struggle to read those pages, I was hoping to pass this wonderful story on to my sister for Christmas this year. Now it is a flawed gift, so it will remain sadly on my bookshelf, or tossed away. I am very disappointed and hope I can get a new copy.

  I’ve read President Obama’s book but she is a much better author!  I love that this book is clearly in her own ‘voice’. She is so honest about adjusting to the stages of her life; from growing up in the South side of Chicago and her early education, being a minority student at Harvard and Princeton, finding a career that was fulfilling, surviving a miscarriage, adjusting to motherhood and being the wife of a politician.  Not only do we get a glimpse of their life together but there is so much wisdom.  I would strongly suggest this for young adults also.  This is a ‘keeper’ that I know I will read again.

  It's hard to live after someone dies.Reading your book brought back so many memories, thank you giving so much. As I read I couldn't help but draw compassions between you, your husband and his administration and the current administration of Mr. Trump. I am both saddened and I realize that I can't loose all hope. Thank you for articulating that as our feet are planted in this moment we have to keep them pointed towards a better future we can make.

  This is so much more than a memoir. It is also a sermon of sorts--but the good kind of preaching that doesn't shout, scold and threaten, but rather the kind that warmly draws you in and offers extraordinary hope, real optimism and awestruck inspiration.Written with candor and compassion by Michelle Obama, ""Becoming"" is not only her biographical story, but also a guidebook for life. By turns charming, heartbreaking and hilarious, this is one of those rare nonfiction books that will grab you and not let go.The former first lady is many things, and one of them is a gifted storyteller. Her candid tales of growing up on Chicago's South Side, her experiences at Princeton as a black woman, the challenges and joys of her various jobs, meeting and falling in love with Barack Obama, becoming a mother and eventually living in the White House are so colorful and compelling that they could compete with any novel for their ability to captivate readers.Bonus: The story of how Barack proposed to Michelle is alone worth the price of the book. And hint to men everywhere: Don't do what he did! It will likely backfire. Actually, it's kind of crazy that it worked for him. And aren't we all glad it did!

  Becoming should be on every junior and senior high school's reading list. It is such an easy book to read and will not require students to have constant access to a dictionary! Not only has Mrs. Obama shared specific details on how she is becoming, she also tells how believing in being different is our first step to moving forward in life with strength and integrity. Additionally, it's an informative peek into living inside the most restrictive house in America. Congrats and thank you, Mrs. Obama, for allowing us to peek. But this book immediately!! You won't regret it.

  The tale takes us from her babyhood on the South Side of Chicago through the eight years she spent in the White House as the first black FLOTUS: First Lady of the United States. Along the way she reveals the gift of being raised by very solid and stable parents and a supportive clan of relatives. There are triumphs: Graduating from Princeton University and Harvard Law School; joining the prestigious law firm Sidwell & Austin. There are tragedies: a miscarriage; losing a college roommate to cancer; losing her father at 55 to complications from MS. And there are challenges -- among which the tightrope walk of being First Lady is probably the most formidable.Michelle Obama is frank about these challenges, and about the times she felt she fell short. She is equally frank about the political opposition and the fears it sometimes caused her. She muddled through, held on to her values, and never forgot how to laugh.The book includes fifty well-chosen photographs from across the span of her life so far. Most are distinctly non-glamorous. I could wish for an index, but I don't consider it a major lack. It is a thoroughly admirable narrative.

  I attended  Barack Obama’s first inauguration. It was coooooold! After the swearing in ceremony, we tried to escape early and beat the metro traffic but I didn’t know DC well and inadvertently tried to cross Pennsylvania Avenue, where the President always walks to great folks (good to know for next time!). So inevitably we couldn’t cross and were stuck for hours... I already mentioned it was cold right ? Well, silver lining was that we got to see the Obamas strut and do their “we in this bish!” thing. I smiled and waved as Obama turned in our direction, but when I saw Michelle Obama...I went BANANNNNNAS ! Something came over me and I turned into an adolescent girl at an Immature concert (circa 1994)...and then... she noticed me & laughed because of my excitement. I.Made.Michelle. Obama.laugh! No lie, this is one of my most cherished memories and I have been BEYOND BLESSED in this life with lots of other incredible memories and experiences so this says something.So of course, when her book came out I was exciiiiiited. I signed up for the waiting list at my local libraries (yep, I use two accounts, shout out to supportive friends and fam!!). I was like #10 of 50 on one list and like #200 of 400 on another. In the meantime I watched interviews on YouTube where all the spoilers reinforced the fact that this wait list thing just wasn’t the business so I ended up buying the book on Amazon (if I’m going to give my money to anyone, then Michelle Obama can taaaake it!).What I read was far more than I’d expected. All the videos and interviews online focused on marriage counseling, in vitro and trump drama (spoiler alerts!) but those are nothing compared to the depth of what this woman shared with the world. I didn’t know it was possible to love and honor her so much than I already did (although admittedly I didn’t know much about her except for what she represents as the first African American First Lady - that info was enough for this great grand daughter of the Great Migration!). Reading Becoming was the first time I learned her story and that’s just it: she is a woman wedded to her husband but separate from him. Living her life, doing her thing, inspiring us all while she strives to honor herself within her particular social and historical context.While reading, I cried, laughed, and basically highlighted the ENTIRE book. I sent screenshots of passages to friends who are going through their own human challenges bc her life & inner reflections are so applicable to millennials in our 30s trying to find purpose in life, children who have lost parents, new mothers, people trying to disentangle ourselves from the validation of others and striving to discover the best way to be of service to the world.I highly highly recommend this book! It is raw, honest and compassionate. Highlighting that we are all in the process of becoming and can constantly work toward higher levels of authenticity and love.

  Before I begin my review, I must comment on some of the one-star reviews for this book on Amazon. A few make no critical remarks about the actual book, but complain about delivery or something else related to the physical quality of the book. Many of the one-star reviews that disparage this memoir, are not labeled ""verified purchase."" Which makes me think that trolls are showing up on Amazon merely to say nasty things about the former First Lady without actually buying the book.Which, funny enough, gets to the heart of many things she talks about in the book. Those who would never accept either her husband or her as President and First Lady. There's no pleasing such people, so please, please, please, when reading these reviews, consider the source.That said, ""Becoming"" is an honest and inspiring memoir.  Michelle grew up on the south side of Chicago with a father who, even though he suffered from MS, hardly missed a day at his blue-collar job, a mother who was a guiding presence without being controlling, and a brother, Craig, a basketball star and scholar who was protective and encouraging of everything his sister attempted.Nothing was handed to Michelle. She worked hard in school, earning her place not only at Princeton but at Harvard Law School. (She was not given a free ride at either school and graduated with loans like so many young people today.) Even though she was a successful attorney in a prestigious law firm, she sought more meaningful work in the community. I'm not sure many people understand that, like Hillary Clinton, Michelle was successful in her own right, not just because she married Barack.She could easily have left out what she and Barack went through to have children, first miscarriages and then IVF. And she didn't have to talk about the couples therapy they sought out when their marriage hit a few bumps in the road. She makes it clear that marriage is never perfect, but communication is key, something that so many people understand.Michelle never embraced the political life. She happened to marry someone who was destined to be president, but she had reservations. She feared the loss of her privacy and what being in the public spotlight would mean for her two daughters. But she felt that the country needed someone like her husband and so she signed onto the campaign.I have always admired Michelle but reading her story has helped me to understand this incredible woman even more.

  This book feels important.  It reminded me of my favorite classics I read in school. Michelle Obama is a great writer.  She may say her husband is better, but she has her own voice.  Her masterful use of language and themes, makes this book feel almost like a fictional story.  I love her description of her early years in Chicago, her piano lessons, her family.  She has a gift of being so relatable while being so truly exceptional.  Reading her book made me feel like I was wrapped in a warm hug.  I couldn't put the book down.  Her struggles of giving up her career while still trying to make her mark as first lady, her frustration with politics, how she dealt with all the constant criticism and cruelty aimed at her.  She is such a strong person.  How she balanced being a mom while needing secret service and being so public.  Honestly, both she and Barack are great story tellers. I will read any new books either of them come out with. If Sasha and Malia choose to write books, I'll preorder those now, too.I saw some reviews who were expecting more gossip etc. Why you would expect that, I have no idea.  Michelle Obama said ""when they go low, we go high.""  So if you are expecting a lot of trash talk you won't find it. But you will find an inspirational book that connects her personal stories with the greater social and political context.  I've always been a huge fan of hers and now I love her even more.  If you are feeling cynical and depressed by current events, her book will help you feel hope again.  Thank you Michelle Obama for this honest and beautiful story that took a lot of courage to tell.  ❤

In the midst of all of the terrible  things happening in our world today, it is refreshing to relive the moments of the last ten years that made America feel hopeful, United, and more peaceful than before. To get an intimate look at such a remarkable woman is truly life-changing and I am now inspired to set higher goals for myself and achieve my dreams. I now know that although her circumstances are pretty unique, with the right attitude and the right mentors, anyone can achieve greatness. Time to steady on my path towards greatness.

I am getting several books to give as  Christmas gifts to the women in my life: friends, sisters, daughters. All women should read the story of a woman that built her path in spite of adversities. And of course, a big hug to her mom! Michelle would  have not been able to do it without some help and encouragement. And the guy that married her knew the treasure and partner that he was getting. Behind a great man is a phenomenal woman. And Michelle Obama is that woman! This story of her life is an example to follow. She is a role model for all women regardless of color, religion, or other.

  In Becoming, First Lady Michelle Obama, not only gives us a detailed look into the night of the November 4th, 2008 Presidential election, but she steps back in time after the introduction and gives us layers of her personal life from childhood to puberty and from puberty to adulthood. We walk the blocks of Euclid Avenue on the Southside of Chicago. We meet her parents Marian and Fraser Robinson, and her elder brother Craig, as well as extended family members, like her Uncle “Southside,” who introduces Michelle to jazz and Motown artists such as, Stevie Wonder. We would return to Michelle’s small house that was shared with her great Aunt who taught her piano. We would feel Michelle’s angsts from her first piano recital to her big decision to fight to get into Princeton.Early on, we could tell that the young Michelle Robinson, who was filled with curious questions, would grow up to be an intelligent and independent woman. Without question, you could foresee her breaking White House traditions as First Lady, not disrespectfully, but in a way that awakened a new dawn and era.Socially, it seems Michelle chose her friends and boyfriends as wisely as she chose her career. She never lowered her standards. Her every move seemed calculated and driven by a checklist until she met Barack Obama. Obama was a man who helped Michelle to relax her shoulders, have some ice cream, and breathe and appreciate the spontaneity of life. He also helped her to find her true passion in order to discover genuine happiness.In this book, Michelle lays out a plate of honesty that spills over human imperfections that we all contend with on the day-to-day basis. She didn't hide her flaws or pretend to be someone she is not. Thus, my favorite quote is:  “Barack and I told our stories and shared our stories because too often people focus on stats. Stats do not tell us who people are.” It is therefore not surprising that Michelle and Barack Obama won the 2018 Most Admired People, despite not being in office anymore. People feel connected to public figures who are honest, compassionate, forgiving, and sincere.I hope that whatever Michelle Obama continues to ""become,"" that it will be for the good will and purpose of living a fulfilled life that satisfies her soul and helps others.

Without question, you could foresee her breaking White House traditions as First Lady, not disrespectfully, but in a way that awakened a new dawn and era.Socially, it seems Michelle chose her friends and boyfriends as wisely as she chose her career. She never lowered her standards. Her every move seemed calculated and driven by a checklist until she met Barack Obama. Obama was a man who helped Michelle to relax her shoulders, have some ice cream, and breathe and appreciate the spontaneity of life. He also helped her to find her true passion in order to discover genuine happiness.In this book, Michelle lays out a plate of honesty that spills over human imperfections that we all contend with on the day-to-day basis. She didn't hide her flaws or pretend to be someone she is not. Thus, my favorite quote is:  “Barack and I told our stories and shared our stories because too often people focus on stats. Stats do not tell us who people are.” It is therefore not surprising that Michelle and Barack Obama won the 2018 Most Admired People, despite not being in office anymore. People feel connected to public figures who are honest, compassionate, forgiving, and sincere.I hope that whatever Michelle Obama continues to ""become,"" that it will be for the good will and purpose of living a fulfilled life that satisfies her soul and helps others.

  What I was looking forward to in this book was the answer to the question: ""How Did Michelle Obama Become Michelle Obama."" And I got my answer, meticulously laid out, piece by piece, step by step. From the child she was to the family she was raised in to the neighbourhood in which was brought up and the wider family to which she belonged, to the education she received.She allows herself to be open and vulnerable in the telling and shines the light graciously on all the people who shaped her into who she is, from Robbie her mother's aunt, to her parents, her brother, to the strong black women she met along the way at Princeton and at City Hall.My take away is that her story could have been anybody's story which in the end is the most powerful aspect of this book. That she lays her story bare and doesn't polish its edges: She got into Harvard Law via the Waiting List; She failed in her first attempt at the Illinois Bar; There were always people in school who were better than her. For young women in the process of imagining their place in the world, this is an invaluable read.It was also great to read her matter of fact retelling of how her romance with Barack unfolded and to get those behind the scenes insights into what was happening as Barack ascended to the national stage. But I like that she tells this story from her point of view, from where she's standing. Barack is a key actor because her life is so intricately intertwined with his, but in this memoir, Michelle Obama is the protagonist. As well she should be.I know I will return to this book over and over again because it contains so much wisdom for our times.

  I am one of the 175,000 people who bought Becoming Michelle Obama in its first week of publication. I am not going to review the book--it feels unnecessary. But I am going to talk about my personal reaction.My interest in the book is part of a long-held interest in the First Ladies dating to the creation of my redwork quilt Remember the Ladies. I read books on the president's wives and individual biographies and memoirs while developing my patterns. I find the role of First Lady fascinating and at times even familiar.The president's spouse is thrust into the limelight. The layers of expectations and the deluge of attention and isolation, criticism and idolation, are unsought and unwelcome. The president's spouse is not elected and garners no salary and yet is expected to represent the country as an ambassador, hostess, and representative. The president's spouse cannot choose the family's home. Their spouse works long hours and travels a lot.Michelle honed telling her story on the campaign trail, a way to forge bonds with diverse groups of people. On the surface, Michelle has nothing in common with people like me. But I felt a connection over and over.Michelle's dad was a blue-collar city employee with MS. My dad was an auto mechanic who worked in his dad's gas station. He lucked into a job in the auto industry as an experimental mechanic. My mom was crippled with Psoriatic Arthritis.Michelle grew up in a multi-family home, shared with her aunt and uncle. I grew up in a multi-family home, shared with my father's siblings and his parents. When I was five my grandmother moved in with my family. Michelle shared a bedroom with her brother, separated by a wall and enclosed with folding doors. My grandmother and I had side by side bedrooms, once a larger room that was divided, and enclosed with folding doors!Michelle had piano lessons. So did I. She has a brother. So do I.Michelle had children in her thirties. I had my son in my thirties.When Michelle's husband went into politics it meant he was away much of the time, leaving her to juggle a career, running the home, and raising their kids. My husband took a job where he spent four hours a day commuting and was home only a few hours a day. He frequently traveled across the states and several times a year was abroad. I juggled the homefront and raised our son.Michelle's husband's career left her with difficult choices between stability for the family and being together. She found herself thrust into the spotlight, but also in his shadow with her own accomplishments sidelined to her role as Barack's wife. My husband's career as a minister meant frequent moves, some dictated, with no choice of the house we lived in or the school district our child was in. At gatherings, people surrounded him and ignored me. It was expected that I attend events and take on leadership and act as a figurehead. I often did not meet expectations as I tried to be true to myself.When Michelle wrote that she and her husband had always been sounding boards for each other and how Barack had perfected the ability to set boundaries between work and family, being fully present even when they ""lived above the shop"" my respect grew deeper than ever. Living in a church-owned home with a husband on-call 24-7, parishioners' happiness dictating housing needs and raises, it was hard to have boundaries between our family life and my husband's career. When churches were in crisis it affected us all deeply.Michelle Robinson Obama may strike you as someone charmed and glamorous.  But, I related to her. I got it.After all, she grew up in a divided bedroom with folding doors.

  I have read my share of biographies and let's be honest, they are not all great. This book is fantastic. I always wanted to know her thoughts and perspective and she did not disappoint. She was honest, yet kind, bold, but humble. I enjoyed the stories and glimpse into her life and the commiseration that all women feel - how do you have a relationship with a strong man without losing your identity? I think she weathered that beautifully and it was wonderful to read a woman I respect having the same struggle. I loved her prose at the end about the current administration and the impact it has had on her, but also the country.

How she wrestles with self doubt about being good enough resonatesPeople tend to forget her bona fides in terms of education and employment as she put her focus on supporting her husband and raising her girls. The hurt she must have felt from the cruel words about her is unimaginable yet she always handled things with grace. She always took the high ground, never sinking to the level of her detractors.Her initiatives towards improving the visibility of the unseen- women, minorities, the “others” are not fully appreciated or recognized.It makes me sad to see how far we have fallen since the end of their tenure. Mrs Obama says she remains optimistic for which I applaud her.This book should be required reading. The lessons are legion and worthy.

  As a woman who has made choices about career(s) in male dominated fields (e.g.geology), and getting married and having kids (and doing the ""mommy track"" for a while), I understand many of the thoughts, emotions, and decisions Michelle Obama describes.  She deals with the decisions, and their consequences honestly.  Choices have consequences, and one choice often limits or eliminates other options you might have considered.  Being happy with, and accepting, the trade-offs is important, for both men and women (life is, after all, a series of choices).  I highly recommend this book to young women, and men, as they deal with these kinds of choices.  It also has wonderful insights into history and into Barack Obama's life and choices.  It is well written (as you would expect from a Princeton/Harvard graduate with both legal and public service experience.  I highly recommend this book!

  First, I must say, I am an admirer of Michelle Obama. Now, if she never became the First Lady, I would probably not really know who she was. The public sees the First Lady as this icon, and that I believe she is, but I think there is much more behind who she is, and what she has done. So, I was anxious to read this story, written in her words, about her life and experiences. I enjoyed how this was put together, and I learned a lot about her background, and her life living in Chicago. She came from humble beginnings, and never lost sight of where she came from. I found the book to be real, not just have a partial realism. That Mrs. Obama is indeed a truly beautiful person, not just on the outside, but the inside as well. Her thoughts and actions that surrounded motherhood, the loss of friends and family, and how she fell in love with a man that would be President. I not only found her words inspiring, but I learned about her life, her family and some things I didn't know about living in the White House, the things you'd never know unless you experienced it. I am glad I invested in this book and read it from cover to cover, taking in the statements, whether written or unsaid, who am I and who do I want to become? It's not about politics, but about being human, and sharing experiences to lift up others, never tearing anyone down.

  I learned a lot, reading Michelle Obama's Becoming. I learned, first--being neither of these two myself--something about being a woman and being black. Ms. Obama--I can't bring myself to call her by her first name, which would feel presumptuous; nor by her last alone, which would feel cold--is unsparingly honest and deeply personal in exploring both these fundamental aspects of her life.I learned, too, something about growing up in modest circumstances on the South Side of Chicago, at a time, to be sure, preceding the tragic, daily gun violence we hear about today, but a time when even middle class black status meant lesser educational opportunity and greater social insecurity. (Curiously--and I thought about this often as I read--I visited the South Side during her early teenage years as I worked on a research project into the life and work of the African American artist Charles White, who was brought up in that area in the 1920s). As Ms. Obama describes it in eloquent and compelling detail, it required the loving, often exacting support of a close family and community, as well as an abundance of grit and determination on her own part, to emerge from that circumstance as she did--an enormously self-confident, accomplished, and compassionate human being.As for being a woman and being black, she is honest--though without self-pity--about the obstacles she had to face as she navigated her way through her undergraduate days at Princeton and later Harvard Law School, and landed a job at a prestigious Chicago law firm where she first met... well, you know who. The ""becoming"" in this part of her story is the transition from girl to woman, from the security of a protective African American community to a world where the privileges of white and male most often went unquestioned, where she confronted herself constantly with the question: Am I good enough? She invites us to accompany her through a daunting series of ""firsts""--first woman to, first black woman to...--as she works through sometimes agonizing doubts and critical self-appraisal with unfailing and disarming honesty. We feel her inner struggle even as we admire her brilliant success.As honest with herself as she is with her reader, Ms. Obama leads us through the early stages of a relationship and marriage which are extraordinary only because of the outsize character of its two protagonists. They experience the same illusions and disappointments as the rest of us, the same moments of shared bliss and the same nasty marital disputes. Together, like so many couples in America today, they struggle with their desire for children and the refusal of nature to collaborate without medical intervention. With the eventual joy of motherhood, she confronts the dilemma of so many women who are constrained to make the choice between family and professional prospects. With the growing realization of her husband's political aspirations, she has to find within herself the willingness to make huge sacrifices--career, privacy, family life--in order to accommodate the potential that she sees in him. We find her torn between personal happiness and supporting her husband in the fulfillment of his goals.And finally, once this man has stepped, against all odds, into the highest office to which any politician could aspire, once he moves into the Oval Office and his family into the White House, she invites us to accompany her as she learns to become something else again, adjusting her first obligation as the mother of two growing girls to those of the--first black!--First Lady of the United States. Through her eyes, we catch riveting glimpses into what it means to live in the presidential bubble, surrounded constantly by men with guns and the eyes of the curious, and required to accept both adulation and vilification with equal grace.""Becoming"" is an eminently readable book by a wholly admirable woman. While its background is of necessity the grand canopy of world history, it remains an intensely personal account of a remarkable journey--a journey that starts in modest origins and ends, provisionally at least, at the peak of fame and power. She leaves the reader wishing her well, and confident that she still has much to contribute to the country that, no matter the personal sacrifice, she has served so well.

  Reading this book is like spending time with the charming and intelligent Michelle Obama. The best parts of the book are about her upbringing and then her search for balance as a working mother and then wife of a candidate and President. The Michelle view of the campaign is compelling. Throughout, the spark between Barack Obama and Michelle Obama is evident , as is the work that any relationship takes.The least engaging part was  the list of accomplishments toward the end of the book. That said, the book is very optimistic and supportive of individual development for everyone. Flexibility, hard work and ""To thine own self be true"" are themes of the book. One decision leads to another and to paths unknown. and  I look forward to seeing how the Obamas continue on their paths, and hope that they stay in our national life.

But I was a very leery of reading BECOMING because I had seen so many interviews of her that I assumed that she had already told her story.  But she has not.  The book is an amazing story that young women of any race can identify with.It's sad the sarcastic people who gave the book a one star.  If they didn't like it give a legitimate reason. They are just haters!BECOMING gives a powerful insight into the role of the first lady and their life in the bubble, as she describes it. She was and is fiercely protective of her girls and that comes through as a major them.  She pulls the covers off her relationship with Barack and shows that they are a normal couple with their ups and downs.A great read!

  After a full 400 pages of living through the days, journeys, memories, feelings, and hopes of a lovely lady called Michelle, I was sad - although satisfied- to be closing the back cover. It was one of the few books that I didn't drop or lost my interest half way. It made me eager to hit the bed after a long day just to catch on my reading. ""Becoming Me"" and ""Becoming Us"" were the first two chapters that turned up far from my expectations of exploring the beginning of a first lady's life. Her early life environment, situation, daily activities, culture, values, fears, dreams and thoughts were surprisingly so close and similar to mine, and of course to the common person (especially woman) in any place of this world.  It amazed me how many sentences I highlighted that were reflecting my own words. I enjoyed every letter of it and was eager to actually move forward and seeing her 'becoming' in every step of the way.""Becoming More"" yet got actually far, as I am literally 6,000 miles (9,600km) away from Washington DC, let alone the US politics. But I was looking forward to seeing all these prepared dreams and desires come to life and be applied on ground. I admit skipping few names, few unfamiliar events, or being disappointed in wasting chapters on not-so-important matters (at least for me) such as the grandiosity of the White House, the numerous staff and specialized jobs in it, the security, the hair and makeup, the assets, etc. which are familiar and known in general to anyone who knows what the White House represents. I was looking for the initiatives and wish there were more in those long 8 years, but it was understandable as the life changing adaptation, the protocols, the uncontrolled events and duties, the overwhelming encounters, other people stories and needs can really take time and focus away from any person in charge. I believe at the same time, the number of issues and stories she was exposed to was countless and outnumbered the ability to put plans, wills, rules and initiatives to face each matter. Yet it brings new perspective. Then I felt a tension relief in her tone when starting the second term, as if the exams are done but it is just a matter of passing 4 years with good work, fun, and respect towards her family image and the nation. On a side note, and towards the end, I was amazed (and amused) by the amount of honesty and boldness in showing her disappointment and worry about Trump taking over the next presidency. In a bigger note, I was looking forward to see a big historical impact, or a Change that will keep the Obama's name for many generations to come as they have promised the people, and as she had prepared the reader's expectations throughout the chapters; but maybe as she and Barack said Change takes time and they were lucky to be in a powerful position to actually and had indeed put a strong foundation or maybe build few steps towards the world as they see it should be!In conclusion, thank you Michelle for sharing your story. I am sure if you had the time and resources to put out all the lovely details and sentiments it will bring out Volumes of Becoming.

  After a full 400 pages of living through the days, journeys, memories, feelings, and hopes of a lovely lady called Michelle, I was sad - although satisfied- to be closing the back cover. It was one of the few books that I didn't drop or lost my interest half way. It made me eager to hit the bed after a long day just to catch on my reading. ""Becoming Me"" and ""Becoming Us"" were the first two chapters that turned up far from my expectations of exploring the beginning of a first lady's life. Her early life environment, situation, daily activities, culture, values, fears, dreams and thoughts were surprisingly so close and similar to mine, and of course to the common person (especially woman) in any place of this world.  It amazed me how many sentences I highlighted that were reflecting my own words.

And then I wanted to share it as a gift so I purchased 2 more. A short while later I was visiting Chicago and everyone, MALE and Female, were talking about it. And I've supplemented and reinforced my reading with every PBS exerpt. What is so captivating is the fact that she is honest, funny, self aware and still working on HERSELF with the realization that as good, GREAT, as life had been she cannot rest on her laurels. And her role of mother and wife are serious, intrinsic, commitments for life. And as she is referenced by many as OUR FOREVER FIRST LADY, the mantle she has picked up for girls, all over the world, will surely be a lasting epitaph.

  Hi!  We miss Michelle Obama helping to lead our country!  She is so intelligent and calculating with what gets the most ""bang"" for her efforts.  She is an inspiration!  All females (age doesn't matter) should read this book because Michelle tells it like it is, especially balancing life and work.I purchased ""Becoming  MI Historia"" as I am learning to understand Spanish.  Then I purchased this book, ""Becoming"", in English so that I could understand the words that I didn't know.  It has pushed me to new levels as a Spanish language student!  I will definitely go back and read  ""Becoming-Mi Historia"" again.  Hopefully, I will be able to recall more Spanish words the second time through.  Then I look forward to giving these books to the kids in grade/high school.Not related to the book but to Michelle's podcast about Black-African/American women NOT being taken seriously in the health care system and how people cut in front of her in line at the grocery store, these are WOMAN issues, not confined to one race.Just before coronavirus hit, a woman cut in front of me in a grocery store.  It was like I didn't exist and I was standing in line behind the guy who went before me.  She had a full cart and I only had a few items.  The store didn't have self-checkouts.  I spoke up and said, ""Hey, I'm in line here. You cut in front of me.""  The lady insisted that I wasn't in line but it was obvious that I was.  The clerk said nothing but knew that I was in line.  The lady, seeing that I wasn't backing down, did get in line behind me.  Lucky for me that she didn't have a gun!Several years ago, I went to the hospital emergency room with a prescription drug reaction -- the drugs were mixing with the acid in my stomach was forming acidic bubbles and they were coming out of my mouth.  I sat in the emergency room for six  (6) hours with my esophogus being burned out while men were coming in with maybe ""heart attacks"".  No doctor saw me because they were busy looking after the men.  I was going to fake heart pains just to get attention but didn't want to have to pay for heart tests on top of the real problem.  Finally, after six hours, the nurse asked me if I wanted to leave as it looked like it would be hours before someone could see me.  They would wipe my stay off their records and I wouldn't be charged for a six-hour emergency room stay.  I left with no treatment.  I stopped the medication, slept for the next three weeks sitting up in a chair until the acidic reaction calmed down, and I cried because I was in such pain.  It took a few months for my esophogus to heal.  I now realize what a big mistake that was to wipe that ""non-treatment"" off the hospital's records.  It made it worse for women seeking treatment who came after me.  I often question whether or not it was wise of me NOT to fake heart pains so that I could get treatment.These are WOMEN issues, not confined to one race.

  This book, somewhat disappointingly, delivered exactly what I expected: a biography that covers the highs and lows of life while steering clear of controversy or tell-all details. I picked away at the book over the course of two months--unusual for me as I normally plow right through a book once I’ve started. I think the pacing is a bit slow and the structure a bit muddled as occasionally the author jumps between several topics somewhat sporadically.While I didn’t learn much new, the book certainly helped to cement the respect I have for the Obamas and for Michelle specifically. She comes across as strong, smart, savvy, driven, thoughtful, consistent, caring, and capable. What I most enjoyed in this book was hearing her reactions to the major news events throughout their public career and getting glimpses into the oddities of presidential life. How did school shootings affect the presidential family? How did Michelle deal with the negative press and strange First Lady criticism? What is it like to have secret service guarding you at all times? While answers to these sorts of questions were interesting to learn, more depth or personal detail would have brought the text to life.Additionally, I very much appreciated Obama’s strong stance against racism and misogyny. She does well throughout the book to point out instances as they arrive. American politics are certainly in need of diversity and a revitalization of the importance of an informed, consistent morality.Overall, I’m left with a confirmed high opinion of Michelle Obama and a sense of nostalgia for a time when competent people ran this country.B-

  This book is soooo well written with compassion and passion. This is a wonderful story told with style and verve. You will hang on her every word describing the parenting she got from her mother, especially, and her father. You learn how she balanced professional life and parenting and helped her husband's campaign by learning how to change her style but maintain her identity.The story is told with frankness and intimate details. I was moved to tears as her experiences modeled my own and as they departed radically from them giving me new perspectives on what it is like to grow up as she did and then soar to the heights of fame and notoriety as she brilliantly filled her role as First Lady.If you want to experience a life well-lived this is a book for you.

  It seems 2018 was my year for reading memoirs. I am not usually a fan but I did read several. I didn't care that much for the others I read but ""Becoming"" was phenomenal! I started out with a library checkout but a personal tragedy and then the holidays slowed down my reading time and I didn't finish before I had to return it. Even half-way through I knew I loved it enough to own so I ordered it from Amazon and took my time finishing. Michelle Obama has always been relatable so it is no surprise that reading about her life I could identify a lot of her childhood with parts of my own childhood. I am older than her but I remember the times she grew up in. I enjoyed learning more about her family and friends and of course, her early life with Barack. I have to admit I cried several times reading about her loss of family and friends while going through my own personal loss. The Obamas have always meant a lot to me and I am thankful Michelle wrote this book so I could learn even more about her. Now I look forward to the memoir that Barack is working on!

  I waded through the book cover to cover really hoping for something inspirational. the person I got most appreciative of was her mother. Michelle comes across as a person who has yet to find her purpose or live up to the promise. One aspect I did like was that it was a good example of how affirmative action has worked to increase the economic power of the impacted groups. That being said, the fact that she could reference no non-black relationships or influencers in her entire book of relationships was reflective of a growing discomfort I felt in the book. She kept assigning experiences to race while providing data that showed it was more wealth and connections than race as connected wealthy blacks had more privileges than she did. In summary, the book was worrisome. In the times of hidden figures, we can do better than this for a role model. women are now more than defined by the success of the person they married or by the parents they were born to.

Michelle is a true inspiration to all women regardless of age,  color, or race.It really bothers me that those that gave it a bad rating, had nothing better to do with their time and intentionally tried to sabotage the ratings of this great book. Shows how much hate is lingering in their hearts which has nothing to do with this book.I highly recommend.  It lets us in the life of a first lady, who is highly educated and classy, yet still encountered racism while supporting her husband.  Despite all this,  they still remained professional.  It's funny and well written.  Everything that you expect from a brilliant woman like Michelle.

  I usually don't read memoirs, but I felt a need to remember when there were intelligent, competent, and compassionate people in the White House.This memoir, written by Michelle herself, is very readable.  It's not even that political, as she focuses on her own life, beginning with her childhood on the South Side of Chicago through her experiences as First Lady.  A few takeaways:- Michelle recognized early on that education was the path to success. She was laser-focused on ""checking the boxes"", as she puts it, striving academically until she achieved degrees from Princeton and Harvard Law. Yet after becoming a successful corporate lawyer, she realized that it wasn't for her and that she needed to do something more meaningful. This led to jobs with Public Allies, the Chicago mayor's office, and the University of Chicago.- She charmingly describes how she met Barack, and their subsequent courtship and marriage. They are obviously deeply in love. (Quite a contrast to trump cheating with porn stars and Melania slapping his hand away in public.)- She admits that she doesn't like politics. She was a reluctant passenger on Barack's political rise, but yet supported and campaigned for him. She mentions some of the criticism she received during the presidential campaigns. Although not a politician herself, her every word and action was scrutinized, and she was criticized for every perceived gaff.-  I enjoyed reading her account of moving into the White House and being overwhelmed by its size and grandeur. We get an insider's view of what it's actually like to live there.  While she acknowledges the privilege, she also discusses the challenges, such as keeping her girls safe while trying to provide them with a ""normal"" childhood, having to live in a Secret Service ""bubble"", not being able to do something as simple as open a window or go on a date with her husband, and relishing anonymous trips to Target or the pet store.-  Although being First Lady is not technically a job, Michelle welcomed the lack of a job description as a freedom to pursue issues that were important to her. The last part of the book details her causes, from the famous White House vegetable garden to working with military families.Throughout her life, Michelle would ask herself, ""Am I good enough?""  Yes, you are.

  Michelle is not just the wife of Barack!  She is so much more than that.  At the moment I am writing this review, I notice that there are 11,946 reviews of this book at Amazon.  I am joining this lengthy list not because I want to convince people to buy and read this book.  As an author, I earn royalties on each book I sell, but I didn’t write this one.  So, I don’t get any money from its sales on Amazon.  I just want to share some of the glimpses that I got into who this author is.  What follows are some of the “Aha!” moments I experienced as I listened to Michelle tell me about her life and the things that really matter.Michelle is bold.  She looked back on her experiences in second grade and called her teacher “incompetent.”  Wow!  That is quite an assertion.  Was she?  I don’t know.  I was not there.  As an educator for twenty years, I saw how students behaved in response to a lack of leadership, a lack of organization, lack of discipline and order.  Chaos, and little/no learning.  I get it.  I have seen this first hand in nearby classrooms working with very poor minority children.  Michelle was fortunate that she had a proactive mother who did something about it by bringing it to the attention of the administration.  Michelle had an advocate as a parent, someone fighting for her.  Cool!Michelle notices things.  She told a story about visiting the Stewarts, friends who moved out to the suburbs, what her brother did (play sports all day), what she did (follow the older girl around), and what happened to their vehicle while it was parked outside (keyed with a sharp object by someone living nearby).  What I noticed in this story, though, is that Michelle recognized the effects that being “light-skinned” could have on an individual.  She didn’t get all preachy or angry or cynical, but merely wove a concept into a story and let the reader notice (or not notice).  In noticed, and I have seen this in the real world.  So, I wonder.  How must a dark-skinned person feel, a black person whose skin is chocolate-brown, seeing how television shows and movies and advertisements showcase light-skinned black people as “beautiful” and “desirable” (and villains often as very dark-skinned actors).  Hmmm.  Something to think about in a world where white people dominate, and black people are valued and trusted if they are “light-skinned.”Michelle asks questions.  She talks about having two white roommates in college, yet not spending much time with them.  Did she hate them, envy them, or just not have a lot in common with them?  I wonder.  And when Michelle shares details of the parents and grandparents of a roommate, and how horrified they were that their white daughter/granddaughter was rooming with a black girl (Michelle), wow!  This is real.  Life.  Being different, feeling different and uncomfortable.  I can’t help but wonder what effect this had on Michelle’s roommate, and if she ever grew to feel more comfortable with being different and with different people.  Have we moved past that?  Do kids have to keep things secret from their racist and ignorant parents?  And worse, are those kids feeling that distrust and angst toward people who have a different skin color or different experiences or are from a different part of the country?  I wonder.Michelle endures.  As she spoke about having to endure the frustrations that a structured and organized person does who lives with a slob (sorry, that’s my word), I saw parallels to my own life and roommates that I have had.  You just have to deal with some things, accepting people as they are and not trying to change them into a clone/copy of you.  Good advice, though I am still working on that.Michelle is perceptive.  When she spoke about her friend that attended a predominately black university (Howard) while she attended one that was predominately white (Princeton), I understood her comment “she didn’t have to feel that everyday drain of being in a deep minority.”  I am the majority almost everywhere I go (except when I donate plasma).  I rarely feel like I don’t belong there.  I fit in.  Being a black girl in a class/room full of whiteness?  I don’t know how that feels.  That was Michelle’s daily life.  And the effects that it had on her, the changes that it made in who she was, how she felt, and how she interacted and reacted to others, is real.

  Michelle is not just the wife of Barack!  She is so much more than that.  At the moment I am writing this review, I notice that there are 11,946 reviews of this book at Amazon.  I am joining this lengthy list not because I want to convince people to buy and read this book.  As an author, I earn royalties on each book I sell, but I didn’t write this one.  So, I don’t get any money from its sales on Amazon.  I just want to share some of the glimpses that I got into who this author is.  What follows are some of the “Aha!” moments I experienced as I listened to Michelle tell me about her life and the things that really matter.Michelle is bold.  She looked back on her experiences in second grade and called her teacher “incompetent.”  Wow!  That is quite an assertion.  Was she?  I don’t know.  I was not there.  As an educator for twenty years, I saw how students behaved in response to a lack of leadership, a lack of organization, lack of discipline and order.  Chaos, and little/no learning.  I get it.  I have seen this first hand in nearby classrooms working with very poor minority children.  Michelle was fortunate that she had a proactive mother who did something about it by bringing it to the attention of the administration.  Michelle had an advocate as a parent, someone fighting for her.  Cool!Michelle notices things.  She told a story about visiting the Stewarts, friends who moved out to the suburbs, what her brother did (play sports all day), what she did (follow the older girl around), and what happened to their vehicle while it was parked outside (keyed with a sharp object by someone living nearby).  What I noticed in this story, though, is that Michelle recognized the effects that being “light-skinned” could have on an individual.  She didn’t get all preachy or angry or cynical, but merely wove a concept into a story and let the reader notice (or not notice).  In noticed, and I have seen this in the real world.  So, I wonder.  How must a dark-skinned person feel, a black person whose skin is chocolate-brown, seeing how television shows and movies and advertisements showcase light-skinned black people as “beautiful” and “desirable” (and villains often as very dark-skinned actors).  Hmmm.  Something to think about in a world where white people dominate, and black people are valued and trusted if they are “light-skinned.”Michelle asks questions.  She talks about having two white roommates in college, yet not spending much time with them.  Did she hate them, envy them, or just not have a lot in common with them?  I wonder.  And when Michelle shares details of the parents and grandparents of a roommate, and how horrified they were that their white daughter/granddaughter was rooming with a black girl (Michelle), wow!  This is real.  Life.  Being different, feeling different and uncomfortable.  I can’t help but wonder what effect this had on Michelle’s roommate, and if she ever grew to feel more comfortable with being different and with different people.  Have we moved past that?  Do kids have to keep things secret from their racist and ignorant parents?  And worse, are those kids feeling that distrust and angst toward people who have a different skin color or different experiences or are from a different part of the country?  I wonder.Michelle endures.  As she spoke about having to endure the frustrations that a structured and organized person does who lives with a slob (sorry, that’s my word), I saw parallels to my own life and roommates that I have had.  You just have to deal with some things, accepting people as they are and not trying to change them into a clone/copy of you.  Good advice, though I am still working on that.Michelle is perceptive.  When she spoke about her friend that attended a predominately black university (Howard) while she attended one that was predominately white (Princeton), I understood her comment “she didn’t have to feel that everyday drain of being in a deep minority.”  I am the majority almost everywhere I go (except when I donate plasma).  I rarely feel like I don’t belong there.  I fit in.  Being a black girl in a class/room full of whiteness?  I don’t know how that feels.  That was Michelle’s daily life.  And the effects that it had on her, the changes that it made in who she was, how she felt, and how she interacted and reacted to others, is real.  That she is able to see this and talk about it says something about her depth of intelligence and character.Michelle notices.  When she talked about a lack of hope in the black community, with “a cynicism bred from a thousand small disappointments over time,” that woke me up.  It’s some-thing that I haven’t had to deal with in my life.  I can’t under-stand it, because I haven’t lived it.

  It's all in the eye of the beholder, but I think this is a very enjoyable and uplifting book. I feel like Michelle shared parts of her story we never would have gotten til some presidential biographer wrote their story many years from now.  I won't be around then, so had to get it now.  It does feel good to have had this amazing couple at 1600.I'm keeping this on my Kindle and on my iPad.  When I need a reprieve from our daily trials, I can revisit certain chapters which spoke especially loudly to me.  Michelle, stay strong because we need you and your husband to stay in the fight.

In the years I have remaining know I can still make a difference. My mother taught that if you have hope all doors are open. Thank you Michelle Obama for seeing it through your eyes and knowing we are not that different.

  I admit, I am a huge Michelle Obama fan, and I also admit I did not have high hopes for this book.  Having read hundreds of autobiographies, I’m a fairly good judge of which authors are being truthful, real, or just filling pages due to ego or narcissism.  This wasn’t that.  I was caught up from the first page and read this, ultimately, in a weekend.  Mrs. Obama’s excruciatingly truthful and intimate portrayal of a woman, sometimes flawed, surprised me with her candor and I believe, soul-wrenching gut acknowledgement of who she is, and why she is.Mrs. Obama pulls no punches and does not gloss over her early family story, growing up on the south side of Chicago.  I now absolutely know the family, education and circumstances that shaped her personality.  Even though some things came rather easy to her (school, Princeton, early jobs) her sense of never belonging was palpable.The love affair with her beloved Barack reads like a romance novel.  Her subsequent passion for her children is very real.  Her life-long friendships and devotion to extended family and friends served her well through the tribulations of politics, which she endured, sometimes kicking and screaming.I felt I lived in the White House with them.  Her recollections of national triumphs and sad times for our country are well presented, as are anecdotes of presidential family life.  Mrs. Obama’s struggle to put her family first, do the right thing, find her wings, and use her voice to fight for a series of successful platforms made me feel I know her as well as I know my own friends.  My admiration for her was validated after reading this.Having watched her on the world stage for eight+ years and now reading her book, I am convinced what we saw and heard was the real deal—you know, the old adage of “what you see is what you get”.Stay tuned, readers.  I feel we have only seen the tip of her personal iceberg.  I believe her best days are yet to come, and her truthfully fascinating book will give you an extraordinary insight to a brilliant, tough, passionate woman!

  I think I subconsciously read this book slowly because I didn’t want it to end. Now that it has, I miss her voice already. I appreciate the candid insight that Mrs. Obama provided regarding her childhood and her journey through adulthood. A part that really resonated with me was her description of the limited opportunities her family members were extended simply because of their race. This prompted me to examine my own ancestry from a different paradigm. I also appreciated her insightfulness in regards to her career and the challenges of juggling motherhood. Just knowing that she survived it and managed to have it all—even if it wasn’t exactly how she envisioned it happening—resonated with me. This is a book that will stay with me for the rest of my life.

  Our former First Lady, Mrs. Obama, has been an enigma for me since arriving on the scene. Someone you think you know in a way, but yet never could know from a distance. She’s the product of life and people and choices and situations, like anyone, but her’s is a story that led to the most powerful role in the land: First Family.So how does a black woman from Chicago end up as First Lady of the US? Who is that person you see on TV, talked about in the news, and both revered and maligned every single day?  She’s always seemed intelligent, well spoken, and interesting. But who is she? She was grace, poise, and beauty in a single package, but how in the world did she end up with POTUS?Without question, this is one of the most enjoyable non-fiction reads I’ve encountered. One of the best autobiographies I’ve taken on. Her prose are engaging, fresh, interesting, and bring you in until you realize it’s been an hour or more and you just cannot put it down.Mrs. Obama is one of the most interesting women I’ve “met” - in that I’ve never met her, yet now know more about her than many I have met in person. Her story is not just interesting, but it blew me away. Her ability to tell a story is not just unique, but gripping, holding your attention with a style of interesting prose. She brings you through her stories as a character in story, then brings the lessons, ideas, and thread full circle in a single chapter, or overall arch of the book.I’m not going to give away any of Mrs. Obama’s stories - she is the far better teller of her own story - but within these pages you’ll discover how her family influenced her, her love of family, how she and the future president met, how they developed as a couple, and how they raised their beautiful daughters. She shares behind-the-scenes stories of history in the making and her front row seat and participation.Without question if you enjoy a good autobiography this is a must-read. If you at all admire Mrs. Obama, read it. If you’re. fan of politics, or women, read it. And frankly, anyone who is interested in intelligent, interesting, and powerful women, this book will show you how one got there, earned her way in, and worked with dignity and poise for everyone because she thought it the right thing to do.

  The author/ U.S. Ambassador/congresswoman Clare Booth Luce (1903-1987) said, “All autobiographies are alibi-ographies.” I’m not sure if Ms. Obama’s memoir falls under Ms. Luce’s cynical statement. President Clinton’s deadly-dry tome ‘My Life’ certainly does but Ms. Obama attempts to show how her life dramatically altered due to many mentors and marrying Barack Obama. The underlining message in ‘Becoming’ is about how everyone has people in their lives that helped them evolve. The book sends a positive message about hard work and always being open to new challenges as well as a willingness to learn new things, even if they come into confrontation with your beliefs. The author never sounds like she is on the defensive or bitter. Well, mostly not bitter. She does take a few warranted shots at reckless bully President Foghorn “Trump” Leghorn and dwells a bit on the Sandy Hook massacre with our inability to enact gun control.‘Becoming’ is a memoir about a young intelligent lady from modest means excelling in school and supported by a loving family. It is a classic story of the American Dream. Sadly, the problem is that way too many Americans have a problem with her achieving that dream because Ms. Obama is an African-American woman. The comedian Chris Rock aptly stated, “There's nothing that a white man with a penny hates more than a n***** with a nickel.” The memoir has a certain amount of introspection but does not linger too long on it. Ms. Obama has certainly had her share of loss as well as victories. All the momentous events led to a reassessment of her beliefs. This lady is one seriously smart cookie and knows how to correctly prioritize what is most important. Naturally, her two children are at the top of the list. She is also well aware of her less appealing traits such as stubbornness and need for order. ‘Becoming’ is broken up into three sections. The first deals with her childhood, the second section covers their family’s development from her marriage up through Senator Obama winning the presidency, and the third part talks about the challenges of raising two daughters in the White House as well as maintaining some level of normalcy in a very abnormal environment. Each phase came with its own challenges and adjustments. Wonkish political issues are avoided or very lightly addressed. The book has no profanity. It includes 16 pages of mostly color photos.‘Becoming’ is not edge-of-your-seat stuff but well written. You will not be reaching for the dictionary while reading it. Ms. Obama comes across as authentic and humble. Readers who prefer more moody memoirs or even deeper introspection will be disappointed. It’s no wonder Oprah Winfrey loved it. Besides being a friend of the family, Oprah was served up a memoir that is a positive portrayal of an African-American woman which also encourages people to aspire to greater heights and is optimistic in tone. If you are curious about her background, then you’ll likely enjoy the book. One more thing, if you have any hopes that Ms. Obama will ever run for political office, ‘Becoming’ should put that to rest. She’s not a female version of her hubby. Let it go.

  The author/ U.S. Ambassador/congresswoman Clare Booth Luce (1903-1987) said, “All autobiographies are alibi-ographies.” I’m not sure if Ms. Obama’s memoir falls under Ms. Luce’s cynical statement. President Clinton’s deadly-dry tome ‘My Life’ certainly does but Ms. Obama attempts to show how her life dramatically altered due to many mentors and marrying Barack Obama. The underlining message in ‘Becoming’ is about how everyone has people in their lives that helped them evolve. The book sends a positive message about hard work and always being open to new challenges as well as a willingness to learn new things, even if they come into confrontation with your beliefs. The author never sounds like she is on the defensive or bitter. Well, mostly not bitter. She does take a few warranted shots at reckless bully President Foghorn “Trump” Leghorn and dwells a bit on the Sandy Hook massacre with our inability to enact gun control.‘Becoming’ is a memoir about a young intelligent lady from modest means excelling in school and supported by a loving family. It is a classic story of the American Dream. Sadly, the problem is that way too many Americans have a problem with her achieving that dream because Ms. Obama is an African-American woman. The comedian Chris Rock aptly stated, “There's nothing that a white man with a penny hates more than a n***** with a nickel.” The memoir has a certain amount of introspection but does not linger too long on it. Ms. Obama has certainly had her share of loss as well as victories. All the momentous events led to a reassessment of her beliefs.

  These days I generally prefer novels, but since I like the Obamas, I decided to buy Michelle's book.  It is surprisingly readable, in that there's no suspense, since we know how everything that she writes about turned out, and she does not offer any salacious gossip or details (thank goodness.)  With the genuine grace and class that the Obamas exhibited throughout everything, Michelle simply tells her story.  She relates her perspective on her life growing up, meeting her husband, having children, coming to terms with the many adaptations required in being a couple, the campaign, adjusting to public life, and leaving the White House.  She relates a story which is interesting and compelling because it is so real, so genuine, and so easy to relate to, especially for any woman balancing self and relationship, children and career, and for some, complicated by the cultural and racial factors of growing up as a minority in America.  Also, it is beautifully and eloquently expressed.

  She shares her truth with compassion, candor, hopefulness. I've lived with invisibility.  Got accepted to an Ivy-League school, was sexually harassed and left almost immediately. Reading Michelle's history, I thought wow  if only I'd had her parents, her network of support.  So knowing she is still on a mission to elevate and encourage young women is truly inspiring.  Michelle reminds us that the country was lifted by the Obama presidency.  We need her message of unity. Everyone should read this beautifully crafted memoir.

  There aren't enough stars to say how amazing this book truly is. It's fabulous.Every minute I spent reading Michelle Obama's thoughtful, hopeful, and powerful words took me back to the positive mindset of ""yes, we can.""  She may have single-handedly saved my sanity.  It was good for my soul to be reminded that there are decent, hard-working people who do their best to serve our country...that there are people who actually care, and not just those there to enrich and empower themselves.The book covers the entirety of Michelle (Robinson) Obama's life, from her childhood through the hand-off to the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. So often I was reminded, on a personal level, how we are alike, despite our skin color which many would see first, despite me being raised in a small town and her in a big city, despite our journey's being very different. Often during her telling, the author would meet someone, hear their story, and be reminded of something in her own past. That people are more alike than different, was a recurring theme but not pushed on the reader, just shared as a matter of her observations. Making personal connections is clearly Michelle's super power.The details are richly woven into this story of a down-to-earth, hard-working woman. Michelle Obama is an achiever, supported fervently by her parents and, later, reluctantly thrust into the spotlight because of Barack's big heart. She is determined to do as much good as possible while there. I found some of the specifics intriguing, such as the presidential motorcade carries pints of blood in the president's blood type, the presidential family buys their own food (although all of it is cooked for them), etc. I admire that Michelle Obama kept the narrative of the book about her, not straying into a biography of her husband. I did gain even more respect for the intelligence, strength and class displayed by President Obama, but I appreciated hearing her thoughts, from her experience.Overall, I loved this portrait of the eloquent, strong, caring woman that we knew as First Lady. Her efforts were always to unite and raise up those that needed a hand. She did a lot of work with military families and injured soldiers. Perhaps what impressed me most is that, even after all the horrible things that were said about her and Barack, she did not use her story to bad-mouth anyone. She is an example of class and intellect that is as rare as a unicorn in today's Washington, D.C.I highly recommend this terrific memoir.  I loved it so much I bought it for my mother.  She doesn't usually read memoirs but is enjoying this one.

  I did not, and very likely will not read this book. It was a gift for my wife. Amazon keeps nagging me for a review, so here it is:This is a medium size hardcover book made of the corpses of once mighty trees slathered with the polymeric remains of boiled animal parts and organic solvent-based suspensions of metallic and semi-metallic compounds. It uses the modern binding technique that means if you do read it more than once the spine will likely fail, scattering the sacrificed remains of a natural resource wastefully into the wind.It may or may not have pictures. But it does contain words, just as described. I placed the dust cover from ""Red Dragon""  by Thomas Harris over the book before I wrapped it for my wife's birthday. I also slipped random pictures of Raph Fiennes in between random pages because ""becoming""...There is no evidence of space travel, cyborgs, wizards, unicorns, trolls, elves, brain-eating aliens, or Amazon's favorite topic- ""werewolf/vampire/wizard soft-core sexual unicorn virgin murder mystery"". I suspect it may have some politics and toxic social media fuel in the pages. I am very upset that there was no mention of dragons.I was unable to verify if it was written by the individual the jacket picture indicates it was written by.I was unable to confirm if this is a YA novel (that's a real book with no big words that young adults don't actually read, but their mothers rave about), a biography, or a self-help book.However I suspect it may be all three.Then again, it could be cook book.

  I see there are quite mixed responses to this book, not surprising given the age of extreme political polarization in which we find ourselves. Generally I don’t enjoy memoirs as much as well researched biographies, and I generally prefer some time to pass before I engage with any public figures, period. So I’m going to reserve my opinion on where Michelle and Barack Obama will reside in the pantheon of American political figures until a suitable leavening period has passed. But what I did find fascinating and immensely appealing about this book is Mrs. Obama’s willingness to share her early life experiences and her intimate feelings about them so openly with her readers. This isn’t my first “Memoir Rodeo”, and after a while it becomes fairly simple to detect when an author is “shading”, “positioning” or “selectively editing”. While I would say that her book is not without those characteristics from time to time, and does step on the editorializing podium occasionally, taken as a whole it has the ring of honest and sometimes painful truth. Her recounted reactions to her life experiences as she starts out into the world - joy, sadness, exultant celebration, confusion, anger, pride and everything in between - are, of course, on one level, simply those of a very talented and successful young woman. But of far more interest to the reader who sees the world with very different eyes from a person of color coming of age in the late 20th century are the deeper feelings she shares, often with a raw honesty we don’t expect from someone who was trained by her life experience to keep those feelings very tightly under control. It’s  very much as though we have simply met a friend for coffee and are both in the mood to open up and share some things we don’t normally talk about, one of those intimate moments friends occasionally have with each other that becomes a permanent part of their friendship forever. It’s unusual in this age of fast moving, instant information and abbreviated emoticons to find such open introspection in a public figure. It’s refreshing, fascinating, humbling and disquieting all at the same time to have been invited for coffee with Mrs. Obama. She is a remarkable woman sharing her thoughts with us about a remarkable period in America.

  Hey, no matter where you are on the political spectrum. Put your politics to the side and get into the mind, heart and soul of one of the most dynamic First Ladies of our time. Read from the perspective of someone that really did not want to live in the bubble of the White House, or to be compartmentalized as not just an African American Women, but  be the target of professional political propagandist that love to tear into someone like her, where she is unique, outspoken and lives from the heart.I myself tend to pull my political beliefs from the right of center. I love my Military. I love my Constitution. I love my country and thank GOD our country has a mix of ideas and political viewpoints.  Michelle will force you to change where politics meets real life, real people and everyday life. She is an amazing daughter, Mom, Wife and an American Icon for so many that feel left out of the American Dream we all talk about.Put down your political ideology and step out of the shoes from your one perspective and live through her eyes, heart, and mind. Through it, you will gain more tolerance, no matter the where in the political spectrum you come from. Life is not fair at all, and the pursuit of happiness is not always easy, but our country allows it.Michelle is a blessing and a mentor to not just those that have to work much harder to achieve, but even to me, the guy that so many right-wing pundits would want my proxy-vote. I have never changed what I believe in, but the political battlefield has pushed and pulled to leave me standing on ground that is not familiar to me 10 and 20 years ago. Michelle I think is really adding to that point of view of working hard for inclusiveness. She is also working to make our children healthier, happier and more competitive.Michelle - Great Job, Great Book, and you represent what makes this country a place to where it draws people towards it, not away. You give me hope that somewhere in the middle lies the answer to all of us. You were that Mom and Wife that was caught up in the machine of politics and showed us how to retain your dignity and self-awareness through it all.Great Book!

  Celebrity memoirs are not a natural favorite of mine.  Too much self-promotion, too little self-awareness, and excessive name-and-accomplishment dropping are more common than I would like.Michelle Obama’s Becoming skirts those pitfalls for the most part, and drives to the heart of a complex person living a complex life in the public eye.  I was transfixed.  This memoir read for me like a mystery…I couldn’t put it down. Even though I had watched the true story unfold (however true it can be when filtered through evening news) I wanted the back story, and couldn’t get enough of it.As a career federal employee, I was fascinated by the author’s ring-side view of decision making in the nation’s political hub.  As a wife and mother, I was incredulous at the openness of the author’s sharing about family dynamics.  I thought I “knew” the First Family, but no; I had much yet to learn.  They come across in this account as deeply human, believable, and approachable.There is no escaping the significance of the Obama presidency in our cultural history.  I am still amazed by the symbol and reality of this president and his first lady at the center of cultural and political power.Becoming takes me beyond amazement, however.  The Obamas are not, in fact, “The Incredibles,” but people like us under the skin; sister and brother Americans willing to sacrifice personal comfort, freedom, and privacy to serve us all.

  I recently read that this memoir will soon be the bestselling memoir in history.  I think that’s terrific for Mrs. Obama as she’s one of my heroes, one of the very best people I’ve known of in my very long life.  She observes toward the end of the book that during the eight years of the Obama administration, there hadn’t been a major scandal.  In her public life, which obviously is all I know of, Mrs. Obama always conducted herself with grace and class.  A profound First Lady who promoted healthy lifestyles, especially for children, who supported out troops by walking the walk, visiting and helping veterans injured in war and comforting Gold Star families.  And never letting any priority interfere with raising her children.  I wanted to discover how she did this, how she felt about it.  And so I read her book.  And I was rewarded reading about what I’d wanted to know.Okay, I also hoped to find some gratifying gossip about her marriage.  I wasn’t disappointed there either.I must observe that this is an exceptionally well-written memoir.  At times the prose, the similes and metaphors soar.  One would almost think that her husband learned to write from her as the prosody is so lyrical at times.This memoir is traditional in that it largely chronologically follows Mrs. Obama’s life.  Yes, you will read about her life in grade school and earlier.  Her years as an undergraduate at Princeton.  Not so much about her life as a law student at Harvard, which was okay with me.  Her two-year career as a corporate lawyer in a white-shoe Chicago law firm.  But most impressively, her search for a new career when she discovered early on that public-interest work at half of what she was making in corporate law was her calling.I loved reading about the family’s interaction with the Secret Service, a lot of inside information about the campaigns.Before I read her memoir, I was inspired by Michelle Obama.  After reading Becoming, I am even more so.

  Becoming by Michelle Obama lifted my spirits and touched my heart. Obama writes in a way that makes the reader feel like a new friendship is being forged. She writes her story without apologizing for who she is from childhood forward. She shares her insecurities, which somehow only make her seem stronger. She shares her journey from childhood through her time as First Lady of the United States. She talks about her missteps and her accomplishments with the same honesty. She shares her resistance to politics and living in the spotlight with unexpected openness. Becoming truly embraces the ongoing journey through life to becoming one's best self and embracing that self in any given moment. She shares stories that resonated with me and had me nodding along and other stories that my life experience doesn't give me context for. I felt like I understood life in general a little better from reading Becoming. I loved Becoming so much that I often snapped photos on my phone of passages that particularly spoke to me and that I wanted to be able to easily access later. I gifted Becoming to a good friend when I was only about halfway finished reading it. And... when I was finished, I looked up contact for Mrs. Obama and sent her a short note about the impact the book had on me. Obama's honesty and insight inspired and encouraged me to continue using my own words to try to make a difference in the world. Becoming gently empowers the reader to embrace their own journey to becoming more of themselves as Obama demonstrates how we all converge and diverge on our life journeys.

And... when I was finished, I looked up contact for Mrs. Obama and sent her a short note about the impact the book had on me. Obama's honesty and insight inspired and encouraged me to continue using my own words to try to make a difference in the world. Becoming gently empowers the reader to embrace their own journey to becoming more of themselves as Obama demonstrates how we all converge and diverge on our life journeys.

  Michele O is someone I would love to have as a close friend.  She's real.  She's together.  Her strength is what I've tried to maintain all my life as a woman and mother wondering how it would affect my children through the years.  They're all in their early 60s now and even come to me when they just need a shoulder.  The joy to find a life partner and decide to let him be who he needed to be as she decided to support his dream all the way.  I'm so proud to know a little more about such a fascinating woman.  You go girl!

  We start out in the South Side of Chicago where Michelle Robinson lived  in a low to middle class racially diverse neighborhood. Michelle in her early years living on the second floor  of her aunt and uncle’s home. Her older brother Craig was 2 years older shared a divided bedroom. Her high school was named Bryn Mawr’ is that not a suburb  of Philadelphia ? From High School Michelle went to college at Princeton same as her brother 2 years earlier. Michelle and Barack warmed up to each other one summer in Chicago with  kiss after ice cream cones. Around this point Michelle quotes something Barack use to say to his audience in community organizer Do we settle for the world as it is, or do we work for the world as it should be?” The memories from campaigning in Iowa leading up to the Iowa Caucuses were both fun and exhausting  to read about the amount of time and traveling needed to do those Iowa Caucuses. There is a few pages devoted to the time the Conservative media chopped up one of her stump speeches on the campaign trail and edited into the not infamous “For the first time in my life I’m proud to be a American”  The same was done to the pastor of there Chicago Hometown Church The Reverent Jeremiah Right editing his speeches and taking out of content his racial remarks about whites and blacks in America.  The section in the book about making it to The White House I learned something I never knew that The White House consist of 132 Rooms 35 Bathrooms 28 Fireplaces across 6 floors. She tells of a one time petting zoo brought to The White House  for the girls  where one of the animals lurched for Malia the secret service shot a tranquilizer dirt that hit Sasha in the arm. But it turned out to be a dream. It was frightening reading that part. The final portion of the book talks about the transition from the Obama to the Trump Administrations.  I don’t wish to comment on that as it is very difficult to read. It’s a great read so you should read it. Just keep in mind at it is 424 pages long (Kindle Version)

  BecomingMichelle ObamaRandom House, Nov 2018429 pages, Kindle, Hardcover, Paperback, Audio book, Audio CDMemoirs/Bios, Women’s Lit, History, Ethnic/Cultural✮✮✮✮✮PurchasedThe cover is perfect with its large, captivating close-up of the former First Lady, Michelle Obama, who is the author and subject of this book. It shows her smiling, as I always think of her, but with her hand on her cheek and her arm across the front of her body as if in protection. Perhaps after all the nation put her through, she learned to protect herself and her family, but she still maintains her sense of fun and humor through it all.The story is of her life from the time she was a young girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago as part of a poor black family. She knew they were poor, but it didn’t seem to be the defining  sense in her young life. A sense of family, love, and the ability to be and do whatever she wanted was more the rule. And Michelle liked rules and guidelines. They gave her a path to follow, and follow she did. All the way through school and into college and law school, Princeton and Harvard Law School. She strived to follow the rules, and the rules said to succeed, so she did. All the way to a top law firm where she was successful, too.Then along came a different sort of success story. A young black lawyer who didn’t seem to follow the rules, but who seemed to be seen as super desirable by all the law firms, including hers. She was his mentor for awhile as he tried out the firm. Then he shocked her when he suggested that they go out together as a couple. The rest, as they say, is history. Barack and Michelle became.Michelle Obama shares the story of her relationship with Barack, her parents and friends and then their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, as if we were sitting in her living room drinking lemonade with her on a hot summer day. She shares painful memories and happy memories. She shares the highs and the lows of the journey from successful lawyer to former First Lady. From first date to last looks at the White House and saying goodbye to the staff. She shares it all in a very open way. There is no finger pointing here, just memories of things that took place and the feelings that went with them. A husband in the oval office and the sense of isolation that went with living in the White House…not being able to open windows or got out on the lawn for fear of security breaches. Trying to raise two daughters as normally as possible and still satisfy the security services people without scaring the people around the girls at school. Slipping out with Bo and going to Petsmart to buy him a dog toy without security. The many trials and tribulations, successes and satisfactions that came with the efforts and events planned and carried out during the Obama years. The many friends she made that remained close, life-long friends.No matter your political position, this woman’s story is fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys reading about people, especially women, strong women and how they make their way in life. Tears, smiles, and high fives, this is a great book for anyone!

  I love learning about Michelle Obama and her life, but it must be noted that this is a dense read. Obama colorfully illustrates vignettes of her entire life, from her childhood, her different career turns, serving as first lady, and finally leaving the White House and being less immersed in politics than she ever wanted to be. I enjoyed reading about what motivated her, what causes she cares about, and the influential moments that made her the powerful, driven woman that she is. I had initially started reading this a year ago, but was in the section where she discusses her father dying at the same time that my father died, so I put the book down and only came back to it recently. Michelle Obama is a gem and this was a good book, but it did feel cumbersome to pick up at times. I could only read a chapter at a time before picking up something with a quicker pace -- there's nothing wrong with that, but I did want to point it out. I also watched her Netflix documentary with the same title after finishing: it covers her book tour and some of the content in her book, but truly feels like a separate entity. If you only have a bit of time to devote, I would watch the documentary, but if you have more, delve into this book and then watch the documentary when you finish.

  Putting party politics aside, I loved this book for what it was - a well-written, touching biography about a girl from the south side of Chicago who makes her way to the Ivy Leagues, leaves behind a soul sucking corporate law gig to follow her true passion (helping and mentoring others), a love story and ultimate growth into a working mother, formidable woman and respected mentor to many.I found inspiration from Michelle Obama's story and was impressed with her witty writing and candor.  Sounds a bit cliche, but reading this book felt like sitting down and talking with a friend.  As a working mom with small-ish children, I appreciated her transparency when talking about her struggles with trying to find some sort of balance which probably felt a little lopsided due to her husband's political career.  I am certainly not married to a senator or POTUS, but feeling like I am performing a balancing act between trying to be a good (heck, I'll even settle for marginal at this point) parent while balancing everyday life demands resonated with me.Michelle puts on no airs and it seemed to me that she really wrote from her heart.  I appreciated her truth, candor, and humor.  The fact that a former First Lady, career woman and mother who wants the best for her kids shares some of the same trials and triumphs that I do in my little piece of the world and is able to express it much better than I can, reminded me that we aren't alone, and that whatever one's political beliefs, at the end of the day, we all likely share common ground when it comes to wanting the best for our families and loved ones.

  In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.  In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.My Thoughts:  As an iconic woman who has redefined the meaning of First Lady by her behavior, her ideals, and her ability to rise above the challenges she faced as part of the First Black Presidential Couple, Michelle Obama showed us even more as we watched their eight years in the White House. But as I read Becoming, I loved glimpsing an insider’s view of her life growing up and becoming the woman who showed us an example of how to lead and serve as a role model.A smart and savvy woman, Michelle revealed much about how to compromise and see the best in those who criticized her, showing her own ability to perform with those qualities.In the end of this impressive story of one woman’s journey, I liked how she left the reader with these thoughts: “For me, becoming isn’t about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim. I see it instead as forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to reach continuously toward a better self. The journey doesn’t end….“It’s all a process, steps along a path. Becoming requires equal parts patience and rigor. Becoming is never giving up on the idea that there’s more growing to be done….“It’s not about where you get yourself in the end. There’s power in allowing yourself to be known and heard, in owning your unique story, in using your authentic voice. And there’s grace in being willing to know and hear others. This, for me, is how we become.”A five star read from a truly authentic woman.  Read for the 2020 Nonfiction Reading Challenge.

  This is a great story. I love the fact that it’s really about Michelle Obama’s life. A woman in her position may be tempted to fill her autobiography with stories about her famous husband. She doesn’t. She tells her life story from childhood in Chicago to her time at Princeton undergrad. There isn’t a whole lot about Harvard Law School but she picks up at Sibley law firm and then Barack Obama enters the scene. At this point she begins to add him to the story. His presence still doesn’t overwhelm her story. She continues on with her career and he is present but this is clearly her story. Even when Barack Obama starts his political career, she talks about how this affected her and the kids. When he runs for present she focuses on her and sometimes the effect on their children. Their time in the White House was covered as the first lady and their girl’s experience. The platform and policies she discusses is what she worked on during her time in the White House. Politics from his point of view is mentioned but very little.The story is told as if she is having a personal conversation with you and discussing her life. This makes the story very intimate. It is as if two old friends are talking about the last two decades of their lives. It is well done and I highly recommend this book.

It was also interesting getting Michelle's take on stuff that was going on in the news fairly recently.  I think she handled the Trump fiasco very well and didn't waste much time talking about what the majority of American's already know.  Although the book finishes at the time of Trump moving into the White House, she still manages to end on a positive note.

  I am maybe halfway through ""Becoming"" and can't put it down.  I'm not a big reader of biographies, but this one is very special.  Ms. Obama is an amazing, compassionate and highly intelligent woman.  Among many other things, she explains in a very relatable and inoffensive way what it is like be a black American.  I thought I understood before but now I really do.  How this country could have gone from Barack Obama in the WH to Trump is even more mind boggling and upsetting after reading this book.

  From a reader who is not necessarily politically savvy, this was an exceptional and eye opening brief on the journey of an American woman who has been buoyed by those around her to be the best she can be. Taking that message to heart, she shared it with those she came in contact with, as a hardworking college student, to those she worked with in law, to the healthcare community she advocated for and with before becoming a mom and a First Lady. Throughout the book, Michelle Obama reveals her internal self doubts that she then answers with the phrase that she is good enough and that she is in the right place.If one young person, or daring to hope it would be more, and especially hoping it will be young women, can read this account and realize the potential to ""be the change you want to see in the world"" then her message will of been heard. Change doesn't happen fast, and as she points out, politics are messy, but we can all strive to be citizens and torch bearers of hope. I sometimes wonder if students believe me when I tell them I believe in their ability to be a positive force in a world of difficult choices. As I turned the last page of the book, I reflected that it doesn't really matter if they believe me; reading this story reminds me that I have no other choice but to give them encouragement to believe in themselves.

  While this wasn't really my choice for a read, book club keeps it real. It was an interesting story and helped me learn a lot about the White House, hire things are run, and some of her ideas. While I don't necessarily agree with all the policies out into place or what she sees as being so great it was good to learn about her. I did feel like while she condemned whites as being racist or men as being gender biased and I do agree there are some she also tended to sound very much that way. Hopefully someday this craziness will change.I didn't love this book not did I hate it.

  In my opinion, the restraint Ms Obama used writing this intelligent, engaging book is evident from the first page. She shares her life story, so far, from her own perspective. I admire her resistance to tell her husband's story, other than in the context of their personal relationship. Honestly, I'm unsure how she managed this - but she does. This woman's success as her own person allows any and every woman to benefit from her encouraging inner voice and supportive words to any and everyone who struggles with what society may assume about them because of their gender, the color of their skin or where they were raised. As a white woman from an upper-middle class upbringing, I found myself frequently wondering, even daydreaming about what it would have been like to have the kind of truly wonderful, dedicated parents and their extended family that Michelle had and has. A telling line from the book, as stated by her parents raising Michelle and her brother, ""... we aren't raising children, we're raising adults"".  That sentence alone was worth the price of this book. Makes you ponder what our overall society might look like today if most parents were that wise and applied that wisdom, and the consistent, hard work involved behind it, while raising their children. Make no mistake about it - this is also a love story. Not pie-in-the-sky, magical thinking. These two people deeply love and respect each other. What's important to note, they clearly loved and respected themselves long before they met.

  The was by far the best biography I have ever read.  Usually I get to the middle of the book and find it dry and repeating itself.  This one, however, never got to that point.  Her way of expressing herself through this part of her life was as though she were sitting in the room and talking to you personally.I especially loved the way she described all the famous people she met.  She has a talent few people possess transferring her feelings directly to you.I would recommend this to all my friends who would appreciate the truthfulness she has deep inside her.  She is a beautiful person both in and out.I also loved the way she portrayed her relationship with her husband.  What a wonderful partnership and one you rarely see in America today.

  I need to up my game on current feminism and gurl power. I figured Micelle Obama's autobiography would help - an insider's view on the journey to standing up for one's self. It is a great read, especially the first half, before He shows up and confuses her way forward. Or, maybe it's so hard to balance family, jobs (both spouses), and the perils of celebrity.But she is undoubtedly a star. She doesn't brook much guff from her male role models, starting with her older brother, Craig the Protector, teachers who rain on her parade (as an eight-year-old and in high school), and even the almighty POTUS (who refuses to pick up his socks).The writing style is personal and apparently not ghost-written. The former FLOTUS remains the center of a world that can only glow more brightly. I missed learning more about how well her mother managed life in the White House. The fact that both Obamas seemed to have so few close personal friends to socialize with during difficult moments worried me. Her crazy college roommate unfortunately was not there for her to sip wine and reflect on the absurdity of living in the eye of the hurricane.

  This is a very intimate and interesting biography that is highly focused upon family and the drive that it takes to educate oneself and to prove that you can do so and honor your family at the same time. Those of you who are looking for Washington insider ""dirt"" or innuendo will be bored by this autobiography. This book has a distinct focus on family and hard work, as well as self-doubts, insecurity, and self-judgement. It is slowly paced and the actual ""White House"" experience is a very small part of the book. I previously knew very little about Mrs. Obama's family (other than her husband and children, obviously) and her upbringing. So, this book was super informative for me. Just try not to admire her parents and brother! I found her drive to be admirable, as well as her self-doubts and questioning in the harsh glare of the media for a job that she did not want but, grew into. Her first meeting with the former president is both interesting and (rather) hilarious. She's a tough cookie. All in all, I liked her when she was the First Lady and I admire her even more with this book. Unabashed, confident, yet, self-questioning and driven. Why should women be criticized for these traits? Men aren't.  Be patient, it's a good read.

  Simply because she is African American, Michelle Robinson Obama was unlike anyone to ever preside over the White House as the president's spouse. Yet in many ways, she was better equipped than most to find ways to exert her influence over things she cared about—her daughters' well being, the fitness of the nation's children and the well-being of families connected to the military. My favorite part of this book was about her girlhood on Chicago's South Side, her family with its strong ties and high standards, her time in a select public high school, which led to undergraduate studies at Princeton and Harvard Law School. There's also a wonderful section about her courtship and marriage to Barack Obama. It's all told with a grace that made this reader sympathetic to her journey without sharing too much trivial information.Since I'm a woman close to her mother's age,  I was also inspired by Michelle's mother, Marian, who helped her husband , Fraser, through years of the hardship of multiple sclerosis until his death and continues to support her daughter and her family while remaining seemingly unchanged by the privilege of being part of the First Family.I can think of so many people who would find this book a joy.

As I (binge) read the book, I could relate to her as a girl growing up in similar circumstances — as a professional seeking fulfillment, as a wife, as a mother wanting the best for her child, as a giver, as a minority, and as an evolving human being wanting to become wiser.I loved many things about this book, her voice, her wisdom, her story, but what I liked most was that I could see myself in her story and I think that was a key message she was trying to convey - if I can do it so can you, believe in yourself.

  I thoroughly enjoyed Michelle Obama's recounting of her life and especially her husband's run for the presidency, since I followed it so closely! She overcame a lot, including the jibes and nastiness of the opposition party during the campaign and during their White House years. Through it all, she remained a person I could relate to. Many times while reading, I did get the feeling that she was just like me or like any mother with children, a job, a home, and a husband with a demanding job as president! In the public eye, and being constantly judged for her clothes, her causes, and even her physical appearance, she kept her perspective at all times. Maybe we came from different places and different times, she and I, but we faced the same challenges just the same. Thanks, Michelle Obama, for sharing. Please share the next phase of your life with us, too!

  I truly did not know what to expect when I began reading this book. Michelle Obama gives an honest, humble, and warm picture of her life with it's struggles and well-deserved privileges. She allows us to share in her personal growth, relating her insecurities while showing her strengths, yet never bragging about her accomplishments, whether personal or more global. As the daughter of a 17-year member of the U.S. House of Representatives, I also enjoyed reading about Mrs. Obama 's giving such importance to her role as a mother, even as she supported her husband and served her communities, both locally and world-wide. It is refreshing to read about a woman and her family who put character above ego or fame.To top this off, Mrs. Obama is an excellent author, giving us an extremely interesting, well-written book.

  An incredibly personal memoir. Beautifully written. Forthright. Touching. Funny. Reveals in intimate detail an extraordinary woman who is at once tough, yet tender and kind. This is an amazing saga of balancing family with public service, an ambitious, driven husband with her own professional goals, and a proud, talented, strong African American woman negotiating a world that was at times strange, at times hostile, always male and white, but without a scintilla of self pity or entitlement. Quite simply, it is a powerful antidote to a world that at times is self serving, corrupt, mean, vengeful. Instead of pandering to our worst instincts and basest fears, Michelle Obama summons up courage, hope, humor, and perseverance. Brilliant.

This is an amazing saga of balancing family with public service, an ambitious, driven husband with her own professional goals, and a proud, talented, strong African American woman negotiating a world that was at times strange, at times hostile, always male and white, but without a scintilla of self pity or entitlement. Quite simply, it is a powerful antidote to a world that at times is self serving, corrupt, mean, vengeful. Instead of pandering to our worst instincts and basest fears, Michelle Obama summons up courage, hope, humor, and perseverance. Brilliant.

  Michelle Obama takes the reader on an engaging journey from her childhood and how she was raised to her adulthood. She explains how her values and beliefs were shaped and how, at times, she wa so busy meeting what she believed was expected of her and her methodology of checking off the boxes she needed to check in order to succeed, that at times she seemed to find herself following what she thought was her dream, but really wasn’t. She wrote honestly about how she began to view life differently as she met certain individuals, especially her current husband. She explores the expectations on women, particularly those of color, and how often it is hard to find your place in the works unless you have already begun doing so during one’s youth and formative years. Something she covers from the very beginning of the biography.

A truthful and in depth portrayal of Michelle Obama’s life as a child, teen and adult and how she is continually evolving as she encounters new experiences that expands her worldview. A buopgraphy anyone will enjoy reading,but really touches the deep areas within women’s lives, in particular.Rating: 5.0⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

  She tells her story in a way that feels real and truthful.  I admire the openness about her reluctance to be a part of of the political storm and why.  It felt like someone telling their story one on one.  It isn't hard to see why so many people love her.  There is a core honesty that comes through in this book about a special group of people who went to the Whitehouse and tried hard to make things better.The most hopeful thing is that she believes others out in the world are still holding on to hope and moving toward light.  Sparks were lit during the Obama family's turn in office that will blossom in the future and bring us back from the lowest common denominator we see now.  It's good to know that the whole family is still out in the world working in different ways to help get to ""when they go low, we go high"".

  I so enjoyed this book. Living the Obama years, for me, was like living historic magic. Especially when compared to the current dark and  disheartening times. It was gratifying to read that what I'd imagined Michelle Obama to be like behind the scenes, seemed true and very real as addressed in her book. I really enjoyed the flow of the book and how engaged it kept me. Fiercely protective of her children, her family, her ideals, she writes with the voice of someone who was not only the First Lady, a woman on the fast track to a partnership in a law firm, a warm hearted truth speaking woman who could be your neighbor or your BFF. I admire her so much and appreciate her ideals, hard work and legacy even more.

  This is one of the best books I have ever read.  Hated for it to end.  Her writing style made this hard to put down and I enjoyed it so much.  I couldn't wait for Michelle to write about herself, her years in school, college, working and the 8 years in the White House.  I always said, when they are no longer in the White House, I wanted the backstory of what it was like for the first people of color to be President and First Lady.  Their girls are adorable and have grown into such beautiful young women.  Not a single step out of line for any of them, and people were cruel during his run for president and still Michelle and Barack were able to raise such confident, smart young people.  I almost felt that the day they left office was the first time in 8 years that they could exhale.  I miss them, each and every one of them everyday.  I believe most of the country misses them and live in fear as to what will happen to this beautiful country.  Can we ever go back???  How much damage will the Republicans allow to happen to this experiment in democracy just to not have to stand up to this dangerous person.  Will they ever put country before party.  I doubt it.  Highly recommend this book.  If you can't afford to buy it, steal it.  It's that good.

  Very interesting look into her (their) lives.  I learned a lot from her perspective about growing up black and the struggles she had, ones that we all have, with supporting the ones we love and also trying to be true to ourselves.  I love the bond that she and Barack share and the immense love they have for their daughters and the thought and care that went into all her decisions about them.  Her story is all of our stories about facing the ups and downs of life.  I found it very interesting to read about life in the White House.  I am not quite finished with the book but have really enjoyed it all.  I have always been impressed by them and am even more so now.  Life is not perfect and people are not perfect, but some just come closer than others, and they are one of them.

  First, let me say that while an avid reader, I choose historical fiction and an occasional mystery/legal thriller over memoirs/non-fiction, with just a few exceptions. Michelle Obama’s BECOMING is one of those exceptions. For one thing, I was intrigued by the title. Frankly, it could have gone either way -- I could have been impressed with her honesty or annoyed by her arrogance; so, although I was very impressed with how she handled herself during her husband’s campaigns [for President] and adored her as First Lady, I didn’t really know what to expect from her memoir. Well, as you’ve guessed from the number of stars, it was much more than I expected – it was a deep, revealing and unvarnished dive into her life, written beautifully, with all the wisdom and grace she embodied during her eight years in the White House. And she has a knack for making you feel as if she’s talking directly to you, not as if she’s writing for a wide audience, but that she’s confiding only in you -- makes you want to keep reading.There’s not a wasted word in this book, nor do I believe there is exaggeration or tomfoolery of any kind. Descriptions from her childhood, high school and college years are astonishing in their vividness and give testament to her extraordinary memory and gift for detail. Scenes from her marriage expose her struggles with loneliness while, at the same, supporting her husband’s political aspirations.All that said, maybe more important than anything else, Michelle sheds a bright light on what it means to be Black in America. Everyone over the age of 12 should read it.Needless to say, I recommend this book highly.

  What does it mean to be First Lady—especially if you and your husband arrive in the White House with a different culture and racial background than your predecessors?It means putting your personal goals for your own life on hold while supporting your husband, keeping your children out of the spotlight, and putting forth your own agenda to protect the health and education of all children. It means letting your personal life and values shine through—but not too brightly—while adjusting to expectations that life has not prepared you for. It means discovering what you can and cannot control, and embracing what is right regardless of how you may feel about insults hurled at you. And it means finding ways to remain optimistic because change is always happening. In Becoming Michelle Obama discusses who she was, who she became, and where she is headed now.Born Michelle Robinson, Mrs. Obama grew up on the South Side of Chicago. Her parents lived in the apartment above her great aunt, and her family was always a priority. Her mother was her rock and went to Bryn Mawr School when Michelle was in second grade to pull her out of a classroom where the teacher let discipline problems keep out education. She traveled across town to an accelerated high school, and despite her counselor’s warning that she was not Princeton material, she applied and was accepted. She followed that with Harvard Law and the legal career she thought she wanted. It was not enough except in one way: she met Barack Obama there. When he went into politics she followed reluctantly, but he had a charm that worked and together they became the first African American First Family. Lotta firsts for all of the Obamas.In this one-of-a-kind story we get an inside look at her goals, desires, and hopes as she explains the differences between Barack and her . With wisdom, experience, and insight, she explores the values that made her life a success, identifies the people who assisted her along the way, and reflects on the many turning points in her life. Her book is a woman’s look at inclusivity and life in the White House. It is a story like no other, and if you haven’t already read this one, you should. Strongly recommended.

  I admit that I actually preordered the kindlebook Becoming by Michelle Obama by around the March 13, 2018 timeframe via Amazon with money obtained from my university employment.  She goes into how the elements of her early upbringing indirectly influenced her achievement oriented drive during her high school years, college, and even her first years in her law career.  She explains how she and former President Obama met, some of the ways that he had grown up/some of the multiple experiences that matured him, the love that she had for her parents and what she went through trying to convince her dad to get some medical care for a legitimate concern she had when he at first was reluctant to do so, some of the things she was experiencing and feeling when she had to help her mother and brother bury her dad, the circumstances involving her wedding and a wedding song that was picked, the wedding honeymoon in California, her feelings and the circumstances surrounding the career/employment she had with Public Allies, multiple circumstances both professionally and personally that indirectly influenced her husband to enter politics and much more.

  I started reading this book just right before Christmas and only just finished because of commitments to review other books. Every time I picked it back up, I felt as if I'd never set it down. Mrs. Obama's first person writing style left me hearing her voice in my head with each sentence I read and that was a wonderful treat! I am simply awed by her grace and dignity and the care and concern she has for others. I'd recommend this book to any and everyone who wants to read a true, gritty, shoulder to the wheel memoir that speaks to the soul and finding fulfillment after a ""swerve"". This story will inspire them to reach for the stars and to not settle for just OK. I, personally, will always keep the Obamas' mantra front and center in my interactions with others: ""when they go low, we go high"".

  Lindas Book Obsession Reviews “Becoming” by Michelle Obama, Crown Publishing Group, November 13, 2018In Michelle Obama’s Memoir, “Becoming”, Michelle Obama does an amazing job of vividly describing her life and experiences from South Chicago, to First Lady of the White House, and after. The author describes her life growing up with her parents and brother in a family member’s house on the top floor. She loved music and playing the piano. As a child, Michelle mentions she was determined and full of questions. When things seemed unfair at school, her mother would help balance out Michelle’s feelings as well as what was going on in school.Determination led Michelle to an Ivy League college and to become an attorney who was a mentor for a young man, Barack Obama. Michelle realized that she was not happy practicing in law, and left for other jobs that better fulfilled her needs of giving to people in the community.In this wonderful memoir, we get a glimpse of a hard-working, strong and independent woman that balances motherhood, work, and being the First Lady.  I would highly recommend this inspirational book for those who enjoy memoirs and being part of History.

Which is...deplorable.Enough said, as it speaks for itself.This autobiography of Michelle Obama is long, and sometimes tends to focus on minutia, but such is the case with most books of this nature.As someone that lived in Chicago around the same time as when she was growing up, I found the descriptions of her childhood environment fun to read.Interesting how from an early age she she had the philosophy of 'when they go low, we go high'... despite racism and a high school counselor discouraging her from applying to Princeton.Outlining her tenure as First Lady,she tells it as it was, never stooping to name-calling or whining. Certainly a First Lady a country can be proud of.And is.

  I was hearing and seeing all over social media that Michelle Obama came out with a memoir and I knew immediately that I wanted to read it. I borrowed it from my school library and then begun. When I was reading this book it was winter break I was so dedicated that in one full day of reading this book I completed it. All the words flowed so nicely together. Every single page was written beautifully. I couldn’t put the book down. Page after page the book just kept getting better. Michelle mentioned her upbringing, what it was like being first lady, and much more. Whenever she described those moments, you felt as if you were in her shoes. I particularly love the way she described learning how to play the piano. Overall, her writing is phenomenal and I would definitely recommend this book to any one of any age.

  Michelle Obama takes us on an introspective journey thru her quiet, curious world in her early days to the confident woman serving our nation as a respected First Lady. Had no idea how deeply she questioned her ability to conquer anything in her world, but she stubbornly stepped forward. She learned to play the piano in South Side Chicago and adeptly handled school counselors who questioned her courses and college choices. She became a lawyer because, well, why not (as she wrote)? She met and married her best friend and joined him in expertly leading people at the local, state and national level (even tho she did not like the political realm). She set goals and stridently met, then exceeded them. Their two girls were always first on her list—always. What a woman to admire!

  She's a human being with delightful quirks and humbling flaws, brilliant thoughts and brave actions, times of joy and laughter, and times of pain and excruciating sadness.The book didn't call to me at first--just another autobiography of a celebrity.  Then in February, 2019,  I saw a  Henry Louis Gates documentary in which tears rolled down Jesse Jackson's cheeks as he heard the news that Barak Obama was our next president, and I cried with him, just as I had cried when I myself had heard the wonderful news in 2008.  After the program I downloaded ""Becoming,"" if for no other reason than to remind myself of the time when a great family once occupied the White House.I was pleasantly surprised that it was an exciting page-turner as well.

After the program I downloaded ""Becoming,"" if for no other reason than to remind myself of the time when a great family once occupied the White House.I was pleasantly surprised that it was an exciting page-turner as well.

  Michelle  Obama  says almost exactly what I have tried to  live and be in my life although  we are  ourselves.  While I am  20 years older and grew up on a farm in Northern  Illinois my spirit holds great hope that the youth coming  behind us will have a better  understanding and  chance for resilience  and love of humanity that unfolds in these pages. BRAVO Michelle

  This is a good memoir eloquently done by the former First Lady Michelle Obama. I don't have any political stand but by reading this book I heard an honest voice and someone who has integrity. She is very consistent about what she wants in life and never afraid to be vocal about it. She is also a very competitive person in nature and that shows in everything she's done since a little girl at school and later a prominent lawyer. She's not holding back in putting all these life experiences into this book and sharing with millions - A door she holds wide open for us to have the access to know her as a real person, her growing up in Chicago and how she finds her way all the way to the White House. I like how honest she is in this book and her consistency of every life event, and her courage to pursue what she wants in life and never be shy about it. A great inspiration to millions of young girls out there who has their minds set to pursue higher education, equality, key functions at private or public sectors, or anything else a modern woman might think worth achieving. A wonderful read!

  I was enjoying this book until I got to page 178 and realized that the print on every other page until page 207 was too faint to read.  I started reading the book after the return deadline, so now I'm stuck with a defective book.  I guess I should have turned every single page when I first got it to make sure I could read it, but who does that?  I assumed when I bought it that I would be able to read the print on every page.  That seems reasonable.  I'd like the seller to replace the book, please.

  From the beginning to the end, this book was stunning. It was real, classy, honest, basically everything I'd hoped for when I first chose to read it. I'm not a person who typically gravitate towards biographies (auto or otherwise), but this book did not disappoint. Michelle Obama managed to summarize her life and accomplishments, along with those of her family, with a humility and grace some people can't even fathom. Reading this left me wishing I could know this woman in person, not because of what she represented, but because she is so human; making choices and doing the best she can with what she's been given. Throughout the entire book, there is a hope and optimism, despite every obstacle. I cannot recommend this book enough.

  How terribly unfortunate for the current person acting as First Lady to have followed Michelle Obama.  It's really quite a tragedy but it's unlikely that Melania Trump has any more self-awareness than her husband has so she probably thinks she's doing a fine job - when in fact she's nothing but a lump of bones and angles and unfit to be in that position.  By contrast, Michelle also didn't look to become First Lady but assumed the mantle with extraordinary grace.  On balance Michelle undoubtedly accomplished a lot more than her husband did given that all she had in her lap on inauguration day was a bowl of jello - an unscripted bowl of jello.  My First Lady memories go back to Mamie Eisenhower:  Jackie Kennedy is probably the only other First Lady who can match Michelle for elevating the position of First Lady way beyond what the others did and in some ways overshadowed the POTUS.  Most of the First Ladies receded into the background once POTUS was out of office:  Michelle will never do that.  She can't:  she has much more to accomplish.  Melania Trump has made absolutely no impact whatsoever while she's been FLOTUS and that will be her legacy.  A big zero who will soon be forgotten.  Not so with Michelle.  More power to her.

  I found NOTHING I could say negative about this book. She is an excellent writer. It's a truly inspirational book. She finds good in almost every person and situation (even if it's a bad situation, you can learn from it). Her positive attitude came from loving, giving, hard-working parents who were determined their children should have every chance for success they could give them. There were so many events her stubborn spirit helped her overcome. She is the kind of person I want for a friend. It's a superb book for anyone, and especially those with a love of U. S. history.

  Splurging for the Audible audio book together with the Kindle version was so nice for the usual reasons of being able to sometimes read, sometimes listen but even more so getting to hear Michelle Obama tell it in her own voice. Of course, before reading, I knew I'd love it because I love listening to Michelle whenever she speaks. If you already don't like her, you don't, and this book probably isn't for you. For the rest of us who cannot get enough of Michelle's warmth, insight, truth-telling, intellect, beautiful and powerful way with words and interesting stories from her life growing up, being grown and raising a family, this has all of that. I knew a good bit about her life but have even more admiration for her after reading this - at every point in her life, whatever difficulties, she handled herself with dignity and grace while also just being so regular and real. It was interesting reading about life on the campaign trail and in the White House and hearing her behind the scenes account of various moments we witnessed. I never wanted this to end and will probably read and listen again.

  I found her childhood to be the most engaging part of the book. Reading the first few chapters I couldn't put the book down but as it transitioned into the politics it got dry and it honestly felt like she didn't want to talk about it. Like she wasn't interested. She also harps about being a mother. It's repetitious and dull and in my opinion could have been left out. Like most books it could have been shorter. I do like how she talks up about everyone around her and does not try to say she or her husband are better than anyone. I like her honesty and bluntness. She made me laugh and cry. I understood her and allowed among easily. I did learn a bunch if things I didnt know and for that truly enjoyed the read.

  Michelle Obama’s beautifully written memoir allows the reader to see the kind, down-to-earth, civic minded person she is. While this was always evident to me, the story provided an in-depth look at these character traits, and it also described how her supportive, loving family shaped her to be the person she is. In many ways, I identified with her: growing up a kid in the 70’s and 80’s, trying to figure out how to make my life meaningful by leaving a business career and going into education, etc. But what I also took away from her story was something I didn’t expect and will never take for granted. We can never truly understand a person’s circumstances unless we have lived them, but, we can learn to be accepting of diversity to make this world a better place in which to live. It is my hope that readers who tend to think otherwise, read this book and come away enlightened.

It was interesting to read about Michelle's early life and think about the parallels and differences between hers and mine (we're nearly the same age).  This was just a well-written, inspiring story about a real woman; one who has done a lot with just a little and still remains humble and  true to herself.

  Michelle and Barack Obama are a class act.  They are hard working, intelligent, well-read, and above all, compassionate.  They worked hard for everything.  Isn't that the American dream?  So much needed progress was made for Americans during their 8 year tenure; Healthcare for those who had none; school lunches based on nutrition; opportunities through mentoring for young people; badly needed role models for members of all minorities.  And most importantly, leadership based on the premise that life in America can get better.  And it did, regardless of how measured.To watch now as every program established during the Obama Administration is systematically dismantled by the presidential clown now in office, enabled by the entire Republican Party who sits fiddling while Rome burns, is criminal.  I hope that in November 2020, voters finally stop drinking the ""clown's kool-aid"" and open their eyes.  The clown has not made America great again.  But he has made America hate again.

I did not know much about her background but her life has been an extraordinary example of the American dream.  Her childhood was not so very different from mine, as far as the family and family values are concerned.  Her circumstances were slightly different, especially because of the racial component, but I could truly relate to the story she told.Through her writing she made me feel the surreal experience of living in the White House and all that entails when you have come from an average middle class background.  She expressed the appreciation she felt to all those who supported and helped them throughout the experience in a very touching way.  She did not take this experience for granted.She and her husband have worked hard for the success they have today.  That is what America is supposed to be about.

  Mrs. Obama tells us a lot about her early life. Her extended family was very close knit  and her parents, while solidly lower middle-class, encouraged her and her brother - both very bright kids -  to strive for more, especially in their education. We learn how Michelle, through volunteering in community programs, met many people who mentored her and became personal lifetime friends.  She gives us an insides peek at her courtship with Barak, their early years together (pre-kids), and the family's life inside the White House.  She was a great First Lady whose main goal was fostering programs to teach America's youth healthy eating habits and to provide opportunities to underprivileged children.

  Reluctant as I was to read a book written by a former FLOTUS, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually quite interesting, mainly because she focused on her feelings and her family, and barely talked about politics, subject that I hate.I have always admired Mrs. Obama, and now I have plenty more reasons to admire her even more: she takes nothing and no one for granted and is absolutely grateful for every person and every opportunity she ever had. IMHO, it takes a big person to humbly acknowledge all those who helped you reach the summit.She has a lot to tell (she did quite a lot while her husband was in office) and she did so candidly and openly, even admitting her and her husband's faux pas. Of course, she was quite disapproving of the current president due to his antics against her husband and not shy to talk about it, but it was expected.Overall, I was very happy to get the chance to read and learn about Michelle. The overall tone rings true and she comes across as a genuine human being. More first ladies should be like her.

  I didn't expect to learn as much as I did about not only Michele Obama herself but about the experiences of a First Lady and her family during their time in the White House. It was very engaging and honest about her feelings, whether it be about how her family lived when she was growing up, her college days, the early days of her husband entering politics, marriage, motherhood, and her role as the First Lady.  I always thought highly of her in her role as the First Lady but after reading this book I have an even higher respect for her. She is someone I would love to meet and chat with some day and I think anyone who reads this book with an open mind would walk away feeling the same. No matter what your politics, this is a woman who should have your respect. As to the book itself, it's wonderfully written as if you're just sitting listening to Michelle Obama telling you the stories that she's lived through. I could almost hear her voice as I read! Well done!

  Michelle is such a smart, classy, genuine person.  It was a really interesting read and helped me understand and respect her even more.I found myself occasionally noticing the complete and total contrast between this first family and the current horrible mess of selfish idiots that are the Trumps.Their histories, motivations and intelligence couldn't be further from each other.I was nearly in tears at the end just in the realization of what we lost and how far backwards we've gone.I had such hope for this country and the direction we were headed.I'm hoping all the best for the Obama's in the future and hope Michelle and her family do well.

  Ms. Obama did an excellent job of giving America version of herself and her journey as well as her perspectives into her husband and politics.However, there's a definite sense that much was redacted and there's VERY heavy play on the concept of self-promotion toward helping women of color. What Michelle missed in all of this is how many women (white) admire her and she did nothing to even reach out to white women, other than a nod here and there to people she holds dear to life's end.Michelle comes across as insecure, at times, with a need to tell you all she did through mentors that she thought were wonderful, and that's fantastic, but she misses the mark. Her audience is not strictly black but she felt the need to go out and tell all black women they can ""do this"" not even realizing for a moment the white women needed her as well.Michelle, you're not a black iconic woman but a woman. To ""Become"" as you're indicating, you need to realize you represent ALL women.

  Your visit to Chicago, In the middle of West Englewood, sat Harper High School.  In the school library, you joined a circle of twenty-two Harper students – All African American, mostly juniors and seniors.  They described a daily, even hourly, fear of gangs and violence and more family traumatic experiences.  One student asked “It’s nice that you’re here and all; he said with a shrug.  “But What ‘re you actually going to do about any of this?”“Honestly,” I began, “I know you’re dealing with a lot here, but no one’s going to save you anytime soon.  Most people in Washington aren’t even trying.  A lot of them don’t even know you exist.” I explained to those students that progress is slow, that they couldn’t afford to simply sit and wait for change to come.”You said “Use school” you pointed out to them the committed and caring adults inside that school who thought they mattered.  I can’t imagine what that felt like for you.  What a load to carry.I am an American Descendant of Slavery.  I have witnessed and experienced first hand inherited traumas and Complex PTSD in my family as well as my community.  I never expected a lot of change in the Black communities across America, during your family terms in office.  The Office of the President is bigger than any President.  I still love your family.

  While reading this book I could hear Michelle Obama’s voice telling me her story. The beginning was a bit tedious and overly detail of her early kindergarten years.  I guess she used it as a foundation to explain her motivations. There were things I could relate to - things I had experienced myself, but there were also things that I relied on her explanation to comprehend. Some parts of it were raw, but I found a lot of things to be vague too. The impression I took away of Barack Obama was not a favorable one.  I was mad at him for leaving them alone so much.I found the early years up until he ran for president told in much detail, but the rest was very condensed with a lot of stuff skimmed over in a gauzy fashion. I understand to do it the way she began the book would have made it a giant, boring tome, and a ponderous read.It was a good story, if a little tiresome, because I already knew the highlights.

  “There’s power in allowing yourself to be known and heard, in owning your unique story, in using your authentic voice. And there’s grace in being willing to know and hear others. This, for me, is how we become.”  This quote, the last three sentences of this book, wrap up my feelings about this wonderful memoir.  This book allowed me to feel the emotions that FLOTUS Michelle Obama inspired in me while she was (and still is) my First Lady and to also try not to become cynical as we weather the US government today.  This book has set my Becoming to “I’m becoming comfortable in my role as a secure black female educator that knows her actions will continue to influence a generation of young women of color.”  Fantastic Read!!!!!!!

What a blessing to see normal people can ascend to such highly esteemed positions. Mrs. Obama is a loving and beautiful person who has a great heart for helping others.

  I couldn't have loved this book more. What an incredible life story--both hers and Barack's, separate and as a couple. I was so moved by the way she acknowledged how much others buoyed her to allow her to become who she is--she takes nothing for granted. And how she used (and continues to use) her privilege to uplift others. She did so much during her tenure as FLOTUS that I had known nothing about, especially in relationship to education, health, and poverty. Given the current state of affairs, I was especially moved by this line:""Part of our role, as we understood it, was to model reason, compassion, and consistency.""I was also bolstered by the point she made several times: that change takes time and doesn't work in a straight line. An important reminder.This book is so...human. So truthful about her and Barack's flaws and strengths. Because, as she says, we are always learning and unfolding...always BECOMING.

  As expected, most of the negative reviews are non verified purchase, and states generic negative one or two statement that really does not point out why they dislike the book. Most likely, these negative reviews are done by hateful trolls. I’ve read hundreds of books in my lifetime, and biographies are not my favorite. But this book by Michele truly opens up her past and her world to you. She is such a gifted story teller that you can actually smell the scent of 1970’s urban Chicago. It’s a natural storytelling that makes you part of the story. I love it! I wish I was able to go to one of her tours.

  My return window ended 6/26. Unfortunately I just reached a part of the book that was printed with insufficient ink. The middle section of the book has many pages that were printed with almost no ink, and I can't read them. Since this is someone's life story, I can't easily just skip a third of the book and expect to enjoy it.This is a huge bestseller so I understand WHY the ink ran low; but because it's a best seller I'd expect quality control to ensure the book actually printed. I don't really understand why Amazon cuts off returns of books in this way. I finished another book I was reading before I picked this up. And then I didn't realize the issue until 1/3 through the book. I'm a reader, and have never seen this kind of printing problem, so didn't think to inspect it upon receipt.This is a big disservice to Michelle Obama, who wrote a marvelous book (from what I've read) and is a role model to many in this country. Do order the book - but also inspect it upon receipt since if it happened once it could happen again.

  I bought Michelle Obama's book principally because I wanted to have read it when I heard others discussing what I knew would be a book much talked about.I have admired Michelle Obama from the beginning, but I admit, essentially because of Barack Obama.  What I discovered was how little I knew of her, and how much of her depth I had only seen on the surface, coming through her major addresses.Hers is a story compelling, riveting, and profoundly moving.  I have rarely read an autobiography so lucid about one's fears, mistakes, hopes, dreams, challenges.  It goes without saying that no one who is known principally through a political lens these days can be seen or heard under the burden of all sorts of projections.  But Michelle Obama, whatever one might think of her at a distance, could not have written this book were she not authentic. No one simply trying to put on a mask, or to work an agenda of defensiveness could have or would have written in so vulnerable a vein.Until I bought the book and actually looked at it I would have imagined it to focus on the White House Years.  It does not.  Rather, it is the whole story of how the author's becoming who she is, starting from the Southside of Chicago, going to Princeton, Harvard, and then courageously changing careers.  She gives intimate glimpses of her marriage and parenting without being gossipy or giving too much information.  Hers is a stunning tale of a black woman's experience in a world inhospitable to both people of color in general and women in general. To be both and to find oneself at the center of the world stage is unique, and to do so and come away without being jaded or without being self-congratulatory is nothing short of amazing. To read such a story is well worth the price of the book to say the least.Humans have evolved to be storytellers, and we tell our stories in every way imaginable.  That is because we are, like all species, transmitting information as we try to survive.  Some of our stories serve us well, some do not.  Some are true, and some are not.  Many told in word, art, music, games, and ritual inspire us.  Some even move us.  BECOMING is one of those that inspire and move, if we are willing to listen.

  A readable memoir by a classy woman. It chronicles her growth as a true public servant who left behind a career that would most likely left her wealthy for a role as First Lady where she had a meaningful impact on thousands of lives. She tells the story of a family in the White House that counters the picture painted by Obama's opponents and detractors and I believe a truer story of the things she and Barack stood for.She told a story of hope and of rising from the Southside of Chicago as an ""ordinary person"" . The truth is that she was far from ordinary in that environment. She was smart. She had a strong family. She was nurtured by the best in the community because her potential was recognized and cultivated. That's the kind of background that is more likely to produce success.I am glad I read this book. It further opened my eyes about our current political dilemma, but also gave me a much more positive view of a President who worked to empower the ordinary people before he ever entered politics. I highly recommend it.

  This account of Michelle Obama's personal and professional life rings true.  That doesn't mean that there might not be some stretching of the truth or that it isn't interpreted in her very special way.  However, for the most part this view of Michelle Obama and those who have touched her life has a down to earth feeling in the telling of her life so far.It is written well.  I'd like to think that there weren't too many editors or writers who adjusted what she had to say.  It is easy to read, yet there are no boring parts.  It is a book that motivates you to read on.  I know that for those who grew up in Chicago it has a particular allure.  For those who don't know Chicago it gives a straight forward glimpse into the black community and how that part of the population spent their lives in that city. I would recommend this book as a very pleasant read, and perhaps one more reason not to trust politics.

  I purposely wanted this book to be my last read in 2018. I expected the book to be good but I didn't expect for it to be so much more than just good. The way she explains her journey is beautiful. She could have wrote anything and told us her own version of events but she stayed right on top of the truth sharing both the good times and the bad times.Her success and her failures.

  I purposely wanted this book to be my last read in 2018. I expected the book to be good but I didn't expect for it to be so much more than just good. The way she explains her journey is beautiful. She could have wrote anything and told us her own version of events but she stayed right on top of the truth sharing both the good times and the bad times.Her success and her failures. Her joys and her struggles.I laughed.I cried.I gained a whole new respect for my forever First Lady.During Becoming: An Intimate Conversation with her that I was able to attend, she spoke briefly about some of the events in the book that made me feel even closer to her story.

  I was fascinated start to finish by this bio of Michelle. Not only as relates to her own life history and the turns she took in life as she pursued her passions while supporting her husband's, but the behind the scenes into American politics just leaves me befuddled. That the USA can't figure out a better way to get the job done for Americans, to compromise, to put the needs of all of us ahead of the needs of a few of us. It's incredible that something as simple as planning a garden for children as part of a larger movement to improve children's health is simply incredible. We all have to step up and vote. Change can happen only if we accept responsibility for doing the research, listening to the full story, not just biased reporting (yes NPR, I'm looking at you too) and get to the polls. This makes it sound like a book about politics but in essence it's really about humanity and the way we treat each other and allow our leaders to treat this country.

  Love, love, love this book of our first black FLOTUS! She is funny, elegant, classy, down to earth and relatable to anyone who is reading this book. You can immerse yourself in the book and visualize everything in which she talks about from her childhood upbringing on the south side of Chicago to the time spent in the White House. I've never visited the White House and I could visualize every detail she captured. She puts you into her space with comfort and ease. Read it!  I miss having them in the White House!  A keepsake.

  I’ve never been one to read memoirs but Michelle Obama is a woman I have long admired so I felt compelled to read this .From the very first paragraph to the very last one there is a sense of just listening with ease  to someone’s story over a cup of coffee, or a glass of wine.I realized over the course of this book that she as well as her husband are just everyday people who have lived an ordinary life under extraordinary circumstances.The biggest takeaway from this book is the passion that Michelle Obama feels towards children and education as well as the fierce mother who protects her own children and allows them to grow into their own .This is an easy read, there are funny antidotes and poignant memories throughout the book. It truly feels as if I have been reading the story of an old dear friend. Please please read this and come away with the dignity that once embraced the political world and the hope that we can get back to that place once again.

  This was such a good book I did not want to put it down.  First let me say I am in Independent.  I vote for the best candidate, period.  And I would vote for Michelle Obama.  The way she was raised, by amazing parents that taught her to be strong, independent, to value education, be determined, honest, to speak her mind-you might not like what she says but you know they are HER thoughts, and that's that.  After reading this book, I'm convinced the wrong Obama ran for President, because now she says she will never run for President. Why is it the men always run?  Imagine a world where Barbara Bush, Nancy Reagan, Rosalyn Carter, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama were President instead of their spouses.  We could go back in time and pick a few others, I am sure.  I expect another book about Michelle, as she is young and has so much more life to live, but this one, if you want to read something inspiring, is a great book to read.  Forget about politics (yes, it's in the book) and see her as a person, and you will understand what an incredible person she is and how she came to be that person.  Fair warning, the book is not dumbed down like a James Patterson book.  If you can read it on a kindle, that's a great idea.

  This is one pf the most Important books I have ever read, not only highly professionally written and engaging, but - Michelle Obama has outdone herself in giving readers a marvelous chance to really know what her life and experiences have been like - from childhood influences through her First Lady years and into the present with readiness for the future years (which will surely be just as impressive).  She gives credit to her mom, dad, friends, relatives and husband Barrack for her character and her accomplishments, taking little herself, and she expresses grace and candor as well as unbounded love on almost every page.  I don't see how anyone could continue to harbor racist feelings or views after reading her uplifting story.

  I thoroughly enjoyed reading Michelle Obama's book, ""Becoming.""  Her style of writing made it an interesting and easy read.  It was enlightening to learn about her childhood, family, and personal growth through the years, including her time as FLOTUS.  Not being African American, I can never fully understand the prejudice faced and placed upon an entire race being judged solely by the color of their skin without the person speaking a word.  I know this type of prejudice exists and Michelle's story shows how it can be overcome, but not easily.  Michelle is truly a remarkable woman.  I highly recommend this book.

  I purchased this book with hesitancy.  Not because I haven't always believed in the Obama administration but because I am worn out by today's political arena.  I was hoping to once again enjoy the excitement and positivity that I feel left us in 2016.  Mrs. Obama and her partners did a remarkable job of allowing us to travel a journey with open eyes yet not through rose colored glasses.  My wish would be for so many to begin this book with the same expectations.  Open our minds and travel this book .... this journey.  To allow ourselves to become more than individuals sucked in by the negativity we are immersed in today.  Thank you for reminding me that hope, compassion and fortitude still does exist. Keep Becoming!!!!  We are a better country because you chose to help us believe.  God bless America.

  I always had great admiration for the Obamas,  but this interesting, conversational book was Michelle's finest hour. I found especially compelling her story of how she and Barack met and the way their relationship progressed. I felt as though she was talking directly to me. She was a smashing First Lady, showing her warmth and charisma at every turn. It was clear that she never really liked politics, yet she fully supported her husband in his bid for the White House. The myriad anecdotes were told with literary polish, including what it's like to live in the White House, and how much she loves her daughters, who grew up in the view of the public and with secret service people watching their every step. She called out the many women who assisted her with personality and relish. That revealed her to be an absolutely charming and humble person. I think she would get great support if she were to run for President herself. Yet reading her book clearly indicated that is a step she will never take. I LOVED the book!

I voted for Obama in 2008, swept up in the hope of his vision, but was dismayed by some of his leadership choices throughout the course of his 8 years in office.“Becoming,” however, is an amazing memoir, one that I’ve wanted to read for some time. Michelle’s story is so empowering, and her dedication first to her studies growing up, and then to her family and work as an adult, provide such a great example for anyone who wants to achieve their dreams while also prioritizing their spouse and kids.All said, this is one of the best books I’ve read this year.

  I purchased this book because I assumed it was a forerunner to a presidential run.  When, near the end of the book, she adamantly denied any aspirations for political office, I was led to wonder why she “wrote” the autobiography other than a long polemic about the uphill climb of being black — since she has been an obvious success in a highly conventional manner, the constant lament about her struggle seemed uninspiring.  It was a long read just to find out in the end that it was intended to be apolitical.

  Michelle Obama is an excellent writer. Her words flow from the page with such openness and humanity that I was quickly immersed in her story. And in so many ways, that story is also mine and yours. Okay, I'm a older white male. Michelle shares none of those attributes, but through her words, she proves that we (and all humanity) share more than we differ. We face many of the same fears, challenges, joys, and sorrows. Our stories diverge along many paths as we become ourselves. That diversity of experience strengthens our community. Individually, sharing our diverse realities and experiences completes us. If only all Americans had listened and heard this truth while the Obama's were our first family! Even in her disappointment, Michelle ends this volume of her story with hope for our future. We really have our work cut out for us! I have no doubt that the Obama family will continue to contribute and lead. Yes, we can!

  Michelle Obama is a force to be reckoned with. It is rare for me to give a memoir 5 stars, simply because, many times, such books are a self-absorbed, egocentric recollection of one's experiences. However, I never once felt those traits while reading this autobiography. Instead, I realized that it isn't necessary to have the same political affiliation as Mrs. Obama to recognize this as a genuine, relatable, and straightforward memoir. It is only once Americans humbly attempt to understand others' points of view, that we can bridge this political divide.Michelle and Barack are truly altruistic individuals. Despite the nonstop criticism they each endured, there is no denying their humanitarian efforts and values, their unbreakable bond and true devotion to one another, and their contagious charisma. All of these characteristics make this power couple so irresistible. Now, more than ever, I truly appreciate Mrs. Obama's dignity through the storm... and what a storm it was. There was so much that we, as American citizens, never knew or could even fathom, and they both brought such a sense of integrity to the White House - one that I certainly miss in our current political maelstrom.

  Michelle Obama’s memoir chronicles her first recollections growing up on the Southside of Chicago through Barak’s second term as President.She describes her hard but optimistic upbringing: her tight knit and very supportive extended family, including her very resilient father who had MS, her vigilant mother who expertly balanced encouragement with high expectations and her charismatic and caring older brother, Craig.Michelle expresses her gratefulness and indeed sees the educational opportunities she is given to go to a great high school, to Princeton and on to Harvard Law School as a key to her life’s success. A gift that allowed her, a minority, to find her place at the table. A gift that allows her voice to be heard amongst those who hold the power.She describes the “gradual shock” of overcoming her “checklist” mentality, campaigning for her husband, then recounts in detail her time as First Lady.  She (and Barak’s), determination to provide other minorities, especially girls, the same opportunities she was afforded is apparent.Michelle links her experiences growing up with the challenging events of campaigning and  beyond. She appropriately views her experiences as lessons that are perfect preparation for her roles as mother, wife and First Lady..We see Michelle navigate the double standard of expectations between men and  women leaders. She learns to expertly use the seeming unfair attention given to women's fashion, for example, as a means of promoting her causes: better treatment for military families, childhood obesity and educational opportunities for women.Michelle does an excellent job: describing her passionate desire for her daughters to develop into women without the the burdens of their father’s political passions. Michelle shares the pain of the media’s unfair desire to turn events into salacious news, the isolation one feels in the white house, and the damage the political divisions in our country are causing.In seeing the underprivileged not being heard as a plight to be overcome, Michelle fails to  address the need ALL humans to have their voices heard. NO ONE sees themselves as part of a privileged class who automatically has their voice heard. ABSOLUTELY, EVERYONE sees themselves as fighting an uphill battle, desperately trying to be heard. I cringed at the events set in motion when her husband roasted Donald Trump at the Press Club dinner - effectively muting Donald’s voice.  That misogynistic white man felt the need to be heard just as much as a woman of color. Indeed the, “Trump/Right response”, if you can call it that, is simply a reaction. A “dammit, I need to be heard, too!”  While there is NO excuse for putting Mexicans or any other minority down, in order to be heard; the need to be heard is universal.

I knew they were both lawyers, but, I didn’t realize that they both got their law degrees from Harvard...and she got her Bachelors atPrinceton. Double Wowser!!!The descriptions of life as a child, college student, single career woman, married working mother and campaigner are amazing.It was surprising to learn that the U.S. President and family must actually pay for. I didn’t know that they actually have to pay for all of the food they eat.Mrs. Obama’s anecdotes of living in the White House were often light-hearted. The photos were also great.This book is a great introduction to the life of politics and how it can affect people.

Her authenticity, her humanity, her humility, and her optimism lifted my heart.I’m writing my second book about what I’ve learned and intending to inspire others to make their most audacious dreams come true.

  I loved every word of this book. I feel I know Michelle enough to call her my friend. Her authenticity, her humanity, her humility, and her optimism lifted my heart.I’m writing my second book about what I’ve learned and intending to inspire others to make their most audacious dreams come true.  This book was just the prescription I needed to raise my book to a new level of optimistic passion. We all have whatever we need to succeed, this I know.Thank you, Michelle, for opening your heart and mind for all to see.

  I have held Michelle Obama in highest respect throughout her 2 terms as First Lady of this great nation and hold her in even higher regards after having read of her upbringing and life challenges.  I am humbled by this great lady and pray I can instill this same kindness and brave relentlessness in my own grand children who are facing the injustice and nonacceptance because their skin is of a different color.Thank you for your truthfulness and inspiring words, theylift me up and give me hope that the light of humanity will shine brightly and help us survive this vile man who now leads our country.Please continue to bless us with your wisdom, your honesty, and brilliant, inspiring words,,,,,,our world needs you.

  This is a well well written candid story that Michelle lays out from her heart from her point of view. She gives insights into her life and mind in a way that allows readers to learn something of value while being entertained at the same time. The kay message for me is that we all need to give others a chance, to let them discover and exploit their hidden potential through support, mentoring and leading without judgement. Though we all have self doubts and often can reach points of despair, it is the constant belief that I am never good enough that can keep us in despair unless there are others just like us who have made it and who we can look up to as we struggle to ‘Become’. Thanks Michelle for sharing your life story. I had never been your fan over the years as I thought you never really loved Barack from just looking at your eyes on TV and the way you two related but now I see different. I am from Kenya and though I must say I didn’t like the bits about your experience during your visit to Kenya to see Auma (Barack’s sister) but all in all, I loved your story. Hopefully it will continue to inspire millions.

  The entire book surprised me. Michelle had the opportunity to ""enhance"" her childhood memories and I felt that she portrayed and preserved her childhood view of those memories. In 2020, we were just coming off of the Iowa and New Hampshire Democratic primaries as I was reading her first-hand experience in 2007 of the primaries. Along with the impact of the primaries on their family, her inside view of living in the White House gave me greater insight into what it's like to live in the White House. She doesn't trash Donald Trump (although there are a few critical words); she explains the development of their relationship with the Bush family. And, BTW, I always thought that the President and family were taken care of as part of being president; (head slap). The President gets a paycheck from the taxpayers and has to live off of that paycheck, just like the rest of us.

  Michelle Obama’s autobiography is written honestly, sensitively, personally. What an amazing life experience she relates, from her early life full of endearing interactions with family and friends in a close-knit neighborhood in South Chicago, through her impressive work supporting underprivileged folks in Chicago, to her meeting Barack Obama and joining him as the first African-American First-Lady and President of the USA.  The Obama’s have had a profound positive effect on our lives. Thank you, Michelle.

  I am enjoying this book. It is so refreshing to read a book about a strong female who has high self-esteem. Michelle should be an inspiration to all females. Young girls, teenagers and maturing females should read this book and wrap yourself with the positive feelings and experiences she shares. I'm proud that she was our first lady -- I still consider her our first lady. She leads by example and is so willing to share her life with us. We need to watch her now and in our futures.

  I’ve read other political memoirs and they’ve been a bit of a chore to get through. This one was full of relationships, struggles and triumphs written like a conversation with a close friend. She’s proud of her accomplishments but somehow manages not to come across as a braggart. It’s full of interesting and relatable stories as well as stories that bring you inside the world of politics and inside the White House as well. Perhaps it resonates with me so well because we are both women of similar age and similar backgrounds despite.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and am inspired to reflect on my life and contemplate what I will become.

  In celebration of Juneteenth, I purchased books from some heroes of mine and finally finished the first.After idolizing her for over 8 years, and countless interviews watched, I just had to get this book to understand more about her upbringing, her triumphs, struggles, and how she managed to ""go high"" time after time. It is a fascinating lens to her pov of several elections, navigating First Lady life, and striving to be the best mother she could be to children who grew up with the eyes of the nation on their back. I can hear her voice narrate and I loved getting Michelle's perspective on some of my own struggles. If you, like me, have lost a bit of the Obama era hope you may have had in the world and need it rekindled, I could not recommend this more!

  Coming from a South Chicago neighborhood, you wouldn't expect much of Michelle Obama's future prospects. She grew up in an attic apartment, her hard-working father was in ill health, and she was a black female. But her parents instilled a love of learning, along with the benefits of having supportive extended family relationships. With charm and wit, she describes her early life, her first meeting with Barack Obama at the law firm where she worked, their developing relationship, the rigors of political life, and becoming the nation's First Family.Her devotion to her daughters, her husband, her parents, and to the nation come through cleanly and brightly. If you thought you knew Michelle Obama, you'll find a treasure box of new stories and funny insights. I've been reading it aloud to one of my friends who is an invalid, and it brings her a lot of pleasure.

  I am an avid reader, and this biography stands out as a well rounded, thoughtful and sincere account on/of Michelle Obama. Clearly there has been excellent collaboration and input from her staff, family and editors.  Written from her point of view, I appreciated her struggles as a working woman and mother. Her worries and fears will resonate with any woman who wants to do the best for her family, and still be true to personal hopes and dreams for a fulfilling and challenging career. Initially I was not as interested in this book for the insider look on the life of a politician's wife, but found myself more and more curious and excited as I moved through the experiences of this amazing couple. Despite my initial skepticism, I am now a true believer in this woman. And I felt quite encouraged and uplifted reading this book. I think its part of what ""Becoming"" is all about!

  “Becoming” by former First Lady, Michelle Obama is my book for the month of February.  It tells the story of a young black girl born and raised on the south side of Chicago, by struggling but hard working parents who gave her and her brother, Craig the gift of love, security and education. The parents spared no expense when it came to education so as to give Michelle and Craig leverages in life and open them to opportunities the parents never had.Obama chronicled her experience growing up in a poor neighborhood, attending public schools where students were not expected to be Ivy-league bound, yet she persevered, worked hard and disregarded the negative remark of a guidance counselor who told her that she was not suited for Princeton University.She ended up attending Princeton University for her undergraduate degree, then to Harvard Law School for her law degree. “Inspiration on its own was shallow; you had to back it up with hard work,” she writes.While she was a junior associate at a prestigious law firm in Chicago, she was assigned to mentor a second year law student, who was interning at the firm that year. That intern was Barack Obama.  Their professional relationship, blossomed into friendship, then they fell in love and eventually got married, creating a formidable union of Ivy League educated intellectuals with shared values of hard work, altruism, self-respect, respect for others and the vision to make the world a better place.“Becoming” reveals both the strength and vulnerabilities of Obama’s marriage, she recounts their inability to initially conceive and miscarriages they experienced , and their resort to in vitro fertilization (IVF) to create their two daughters. It tells of the couple’s marital issues brought on by the changing dynamics of parenting, professional life and politics  and the solution they found through marriage counseling.“Becoming” gives insight into the marriage of the former first couple, the political rise of Barack Obama, the eight years of the historical presidency, the challenges and accomplishments.“Becoming” is inspirational, it engenders faith to strive for more in spite of the negative factors.  In the writer’s own words, “becoming isn’t about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim. I see it instead as forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to reach continuously toward a better self. The journey doesn’t end...Becoming requires equal parts patience and rigor. Becoming is never giving up on the idea that there’s more growing to be done.”This best seller is a must read with fluid writing style that arrests the reader from the first page to the last.

I started the book yesterday and haven’t been able to put it down, completely enraptured in your life. A life that is genuine, authentic and relatable. Thank you for focusing on our similarities rather than our differences. Thank you for admitting your missteps and your goals for improvement.

  I can certainly see why this book is the best-selling memoir of all time... it is really hard to put down! Beginning with the Preface, I was hooked. Michelle Obama is a brilliant writer, insightful, down-to-earth, honest. She describes without reservation the struggles she had with her husband's blossoming political career in the early years of their marriage, describes how couples therapy helped them, and how she really felt about the increasing demands on his time. Another reviewer talked about her bragging about her accomplishments... I have not found any of this in her book. If anything, she is self-effacing, sometimes self-deprecating, often humorously so. Her descriptions of events in her life are touching, often funny, always written in such a way as to make the reader feel that she is approachable, relatable, and much like the rest of us. I am inspired by this book, uplifted, and encouraged!

  I laughed. I cried. I was awed and horrified. Reading the former First Lady’s words was like having a great couch time listening session with one of the brightest, kindest, most inspiring women I’ll never get to meet. But still I feel as if I could hear her voice, personal and warm speaking directly to me. I’ve already given the book to my adult daughter and a couple of friends who I know admire Mrs. Obama; yet what I need to do, is to give it to the people who wouldn’t pick up this book on their own. Hope you will take a chance on “Becoming” and then, pass it on where it just might take root. Michelle and her husband have broken ground and planted seeds of change. Now we’ve got some work to do and this book can inspire us to help tend the garden of what they’ve sown so someday, hopefully sooner rather than later, we can reap the joys of a more compassionate and welcoming community that invests in our children and celebrates  diversity.

  I’m a libertarian and I liked this biography. It really helped Mrs. Obama to become a connectable human being; however, I do find it irking when she comes off as presuming that everyone thinks the same way. Every woman has to vote blue. For instance towards the end of the book she questions how a woman could vote for Trump. She also makes remarks of wealthy people being against high taxings. As a low income person, I cannot afford the increase of taxes they propose. When Obama care came out, I could not afford it nor the tax penalty. It blows my mind how much of my money gets taken in taxes and I’ve watched many politicians flush tax payers money away with little consideration of who they are hurting.The first 80% of the book was terrific. It was her story. The second half was just presuming everyone loved her and her husbands policies. Sorry, no.

  As a Chicago Southside girl who rode the same buses (75th street & Jeffrey Express)  and visited the same parks as Michelle Obama from childhood to late teens, I was mesmerized!  Although I came along about ten years earlier, I am able to relate to so much of what she recalls about the change that was taking place on the Southeast side during that time. My family moved away when she was about nine years old. My father was a CTA bus driver and my mother stayed home until they divorced right before I went to high school. Although things were tight, thanks to my mother and with help from my grandmother, I was able to graduate college and earn two masters degrees. A strong mother is priceless.  My younger sister graduated from Northwestern and  went on to medical school. She recently left clinical practice after 34 years. We had our racist, sexist bumps along the way, too. Admittedly, we haven't done nearly as much as Mrs. Obama to benefit youth, women, the military, etc., we've done some things. Reading this book has encouraged me to believe that, although I am neither rich nor famous and significantly older than Mrs. Obama, there is still more that my sister and I can do!  I have been motivated by Michelle Obama's authentic story to start that process immediately. I thank the former FLOTUS for the inspiration! ( I keep giving these books to anyone I think doesn't yet have a copy)

Their ability to be in touch with and care enough to take action on the I nation.  We need more like them.  Those that will actually work to make better policies and decisions for those who need it not just selfish politicians and their needs.  The epilogue alone was moving .  Loved this book.  Human decency has nothing to do with Democrat vs Republican and this is what this book also points out.

  I loved, loved, loved this book! I bought both the Audible and the hardcover of Michelle Obama’s book, but I am only rating the Audible version in this review. By far, the longest Audible book I have read thus far....about 19 hours total, but I loved every moment of it. A pleasant voice is important to me in an audio book....it is either right or not...and Michelle O’s voice is a pleasing monotone that makes you want to listen and every time she made a point by a slight inflection, I was riveted. Her story is quite amazing! I cried, I cheered, I laughed and by the time the book was over, I felt I had a personal relationship with the former FLOTUS. I highly recommend the Audible version and then you can go overboard like me and use the hardcover to view the pictures at the same time.

I highly recommend the Audible version and then you can go overboard like me and use the hardcover to view the pictures at the same time.

  Outstanding!  Amazing!  Phenomenal!  What an awesome book from my forever First Lady, Michelle Obama!  I love the pictures from her childhood because you see her roots and how she came up.  The other pictures are awesome as well.  In addition, I loved how she met my Forever President, Barack Obama.  The book is a long read... definitely, but it is an informative and interesting journey she takes us on.  She is a TRUE class act and I am so honored and humbled that she was our First Lady for 8 years.  Those who have criticized her, called her names and started such awful rumors about her over the years are sorely mistaken and truly have no idea who this amazing woman is.  I highly suggest that EVERYONE gets this book and really read it word for word. It will give you such great insight into this great woman and give you a whole new respect for her grace, style and kindness.  She embodies what a First Lady should be and I am grateful that she served us well during the time she and President Obama were in the White House.  Thank you First Lady Michelle for this inspiring book.  I look forward to meeting you one day after this Coronavirus passes over.  You are truly an inspiration to us all.  Thank you.

  There are no big reveals here, no secrets exposed, but Michelle Obama is an excellent writer telling an interesting story.  I of course had no idea that she left law because she wasn't passionate about her work.  I had no idea about the different jobs she'd done and why.The most interesting part of the book for me was the first half, the story of her childhood and her incredibly close and loving family, how she says that she and her brother were her parents' investment.  She paints a vivid picture of the world she inhabited growing up.Well worth reading, and highly recommended to anyone interested in Michelle's story.

  Michelle Obama’s story from beginning to end is a story of resilience, growth, transformation, respect, dedication and love of family and country. We could not as a country have asked for a better First Lady and President in Barack Obama in the WH. I loved this book and could feel the depth, honesty, compassion and passion of every word written. How genuine a woman Michelle Obama is and she laid it all out in all its authenticity on each page. What a breath of fresh air and light as we live through these dark days. I only hope we can return that light and rise up out of the ashes and against the fray. Thank you for such an enjoyable read.

  ‘Becoming’ is an incredibly inspirational book written by former First Lady of the United States (FLOTUS), Michelle Obama. The aptly titled autobiography details how Michelle grew up from modest beginnings in the Southside of Chicago to becoming one of the more influential women to reside in the White House. She openly and honestly reveals her insecurities, shortcomings and attitudes with each transition in her life. Michelle neatly weaves into the tapestry of her story, the long term effects of slavery, as well as, the discrimination of African-Americans and women. She points out the repercussions these have had on the attitudes of the people around her and how it affected her life at each point. Her book ends with a reminder to be open to listening to one another and that hearing each other’s stories and sharing our own bridges the divide between us. I loved this book, not just for being able to see a different side of Michelle Obama but for how much it inspired me to be a go-getter of my goals and advocate for myself.  I think Michelle did a wonderful job describing how each experience she wrote about highlighted how it changed her or affected her thinking. How she learned to be stubborn in some situations but quick to adapt in others, how she came to have compassion on people from different walks of life and how she recognized the opportunities given to her and wanted to extend that benefit to others. I found her honest and unapologetic as she related her inner thoughts regarding different events in her life like Barack being in politics, her view of life in the White House and some of the more controversial decisions she made.The romantic in me was very curious about the beginnings of her relationship with Barack and she dedicated page space to show how they evolved from friends to lovers and the different (sometimes negative) elements of their relationship going forward. I was incredibly happy to read her touching on the subjects of marriage counseling and fertility treatments, something that is usually only brought up in secret today. Despite our lives being very different, this honesty and her personal revelations made the book very relatable and made you feel connected with the author. But perhaps my favorite aspect of the book is reading about Michelle’s passion for people, especially underprivileged groups, and how she championed her policies was downright exciting! Her defense of Barack and why he made certain decisions was confusing at first, but as I was reading, I came to realize how fervently she felt about the issues and how to begin correcting them and, of course, she believed in her husband and theirs stories are interwoven. Overall, this was a great read, I felt inspired to go after the goals I had been pushing off and to be unafraid to fight for myself.

  Michelle Obama's BECOMING is a beautiful memoir of a very special person.  I purchased the audio version for a long trip that a friend and I were taking.  Hearing Michelle's voice read the words was like being in a room with her as she was sharing her life experiences.  Her relationships with her family, friends, Barrack, and her daughters are told in a sensitive, loving and caring manner.  BECOMING is a beautiful book!

The quote that I highlighted:  “...public judgement sweeps in to fill any void.  If you don’t get out there and define yourself, you’ll be quickly and inaccurately defined by others.”  Michelle Obama’s compassion, her kindness and thoughtful work ethic make her an excellent role model for women everywhere.

  Michelle Obama pulls back the curtain on what it takes to make the most of being FLOTUS—a non-job/job that is a rare opportunity to make a difference in the world. I enjoyed the chapters about her childhood and education. She is a methodical, list-making, detail oriented, high-achiever married to a man of big ideas and ambitions. The book is an insightful, authentic, memoir that leaves the reader wondering what Michelle Obama will do next.

  I thought I knew and/or had heard most of what I was interested in hearing about the Obamas, Michelle included.  I was not at all inititally interested in buying the book.  While I liked the Obamas and had really come to admire their family over the years I just didn't think I would discover too much that was new or quite frankly very entertaining.  This book  was a pleasant surprise.  The book came highly recommended.  Twice!  By people who are avid readers and insisted that i set some time aside to read it.  So I did.  And I am really glad I did.  I could not put it down.  This book was a deeper dive into the lives of the Obamas.  It allows you to see their family in ways that not many who have shared that life experience are willing to reveal.  The candor and vulnerability was really refreshing.  It is a reminder that no matter what we do in life and how different we think we are - we are ALL connected.

  What a fascinating story! I am so thankful that Mrs. Obama decided to share it with us. It was interesting to hear about her struggles as a working mom. I also appreciated learning about life in the White House. Obama's story walked us through big events that happened while she was the First Lady. She also reminded me of the great things that were accomplished while her husband was in office.

  As one who has been discouraged by the deliberate undoing of past progress by the current administration, I was heartened to read this very personal recounting of Michelle Obama’s life to now. Beyond being an inspiring personal story of someone who came from what would be considered a disadvantaged and invisible background and rose to one of the most powerful and most public positions in the world, it’s a story that resonates with hope and possibility. Recounting the accomplishments in the difference made in individual lives impacted by various successful initiatives she implemented for children, youth and the military, reminded me that good work does matter and makes a difference even when those who come later try to undo it. It reminded me that progress is slow, but that it does come and results from the relentless efforts and sacrifices of many over a long period of time. It also encouraged me as a woman, wife and mother that I have value, and my contributions to my job, my family and friends over the years have been important, the personal sacrifices I made and discouraging moments are shared by many others both like and unlike me — women just trying to do their best to do the right thing with what they have to work with and make the world a better place for the next generation.

  This book was packed with information that outsiders might never see.  For instance, we know when the media jump all over a comment or a hairdo, but we don't know what actually happened behind the scenes.  Obama is thorough in the examination of her childhood--living in a poor, black community, but with parents who were determined to give her every opportunity and who taught her to work hard.  She is honest about riding her brother's coattails, but she lets us meet the guidance counselor who thought she wasn't ""Princeton material"" and the unknown person who keyed her father's precious car.  Her father never missed a day of work in all the years she was growing up, despite having multiple sclerosis.  Her grammar was corrected, which made some people in her own community think she was acting ""white.""  I admired her self-restraint in the face of the obvious racism I heard constantly the whole time the Obamas were in the White House.  I had more advantages than Michelle Obama, but did not work as hard.  She inspires me to do better.

  Becoming is such an inspiring read, and this was definitely the perfect time in my life to read it (for the first time). Just like Michelle I got the degrees, the job, the husband, the house, and the dog. Now I’m trying to find my path forward after doing everything right. That was all the plan, but now I’m searching for something with more meaning, just like Michelle was. She has inspired me to go and look for something more, while never forgetting who has gotten me to where I am. Michelle shows through example how networking will change your life for the better. Michelle has broken down her life into three distinct sections: Becoming Me, Becoming Us, and Becoming More. No matter what stage of your life that you are currently in, one of these three sections will inspire you to do more, either for yourself, your family, or for others. Becoming really gives hope to those trying to find more meaning in their life while never forgetting where they came from. Everyone should read this.

  Admittedly, I did vote for Obama, so there may be some bias in how I felt about the story, but overall Michelle is quite the storyteller. She did an amazing job weaving through her present and her past with ease. Even if she jumped timelines from one paragraph to the next, I never felt lost or left to wonder what happened. THAT is why I was so impressed with it!What I took away from this book is how hard black women have to work in order to be viewed as worthy in the US culture. I watched ""The Hate U Give"" movie while I was reading this book, and it just compounded my attention on the subject. It makes me even more aware of how much Michelle's own family sacrificed and how hard Michelle had to work to be where she is today.I was also taken aback by the culture of the Senate and its views on family life as well as how much the Obama family sacrificed as a whole to bring all their dreams to life.I could write a book on every aspect of this book, but needless to say, it has helped shape my thinking on race, politics, family, sacrifices, and more. It was really an incredible book!

  This book was very well written and enlightening on a number of levels. It was good for some to see the different paths that led them to the White House from a different perspective than any other president. It has value and I love that the people of America appreciated that perspective. I also appreciated the level of openness and vulnerability that First Lady Michelle Obama allowed us to see. It was done in a way that was relatable and easy to read. I would highly recommend reading this book to anyone interested in a behind the scenes look into the lives that lead to the first Black White House administration and family and the some of the subsequent events since.

Highly recommended for anyone wanting even a glimpse of what it’s like to be on the campaign trail, live in the White House, and be under the microscope 24/7, written by a woman who handled every day with grace.The sacrifices she made in support of Barack as president, and the sanity she insisted upon for her family in a world that could easily have torn her family apart, are admirable. Whether she is describing facing treatments for infertility, what is was like both entering and exiting the White House, or why she will forever hold Trump accountable for putting her family in danger, she tells her story with grace and courage.Her honesty is refreshing. Reading her words feels like a conversation with an old friend. Her insistence on staying out of politics is frustrating yet totally understandable. She is an intelligent, compassionate, courageous woman. Highly readable, her story is surprisingly relatable and does not disappoint.

It was filled with a spirit of love and friendship that connects us in real, tangible ways.  This book was educational and I learned more about the mechanics of the White House.  It demonstrates the sacrifice of our public servants and our military.  I have been inspired to continue being a better version of myself and to see people beyond race and culture.  The story was never boring and it confirmed that Michele Obama is who she says she is and we can be grateful that she has touched our lives in a prolific way.

  I wasn't a fan of the Obama's when he first got elected.  But they grew on me. the dignity and kindness as well as the intelligence both possess.  This is a very interesting book because it gave me the perspective that Michelle's family wasn't all that different from mine when she was growing up.  I wished for a little more behind the scenes at the Whitehouse stories but maybe it's a bit early still for those. I joke that my grandson looks very much like Barack- if they were walking hand in hand  people would think he was Barack's son.  So it's nice to see how a lower middle class family can really produce the president and first lady of the US, regardless of race.  Hard work and perseverance and aiming high just like Michelle and Barack can get it done.

  I wasn't a fan of the Obama's when he first got elected.  But they grew on me. the dignity and kindness as well as the intelligence both possess.  This is a very interesting book because it gave me the perspective that Michelle's family wasn't all that different from mine when she was growing up.  I wished for a little more behind the scenes at the Whitehouse stories but maybe it's a bit early still for those. I joke that my grandson looks very much like Barack- if they were walking hand in hand  people would think he was Barack's son.  So it's nice to see how a lower middle class family can really produce the president and first lady of the US, regardless of race.  Hard work and perseverance and aiming high just like Michelle and Barack can get it done.

  With every chapter I'm learning to appreciate my own life even more. I'm only about a quarter of the way through but this is so enjoyable. Hearing stories about her family her dad and her aunt it really helps me understand where I am right now. I will never take voting for granted again and the responsibilities we owe as individual citizens to always know our candidates and vote. Society was not fair to her family as I am reading and those of us growing up nowadays can sometimes forget that things were that bad and that we're much more free today to determine how Society becomes through our vote. But other than that.... Charming book with good stories. Definitely something that will always keep on my bookshelf.

  She tells her life starting with her childhood. She gave several examples of what it means to be black in white America  She tells us how they met and Barack proposed and their attempts to have children.  During the White House, the two daughters attended Sidwell Friends School (a Quaker school).  Same school that Chelsea Clinton attended.  Michelle talks about her lack of intrest in politics and how that changed over the years.  She outlines the contributions that both she and her husband made during their political careers.  It was hard to put the book down.

  I thought this book was overall one of the best memoirs I have ever read. I loved the honesty of her story, and her frankness. Everyone (myself included) think they ""know"" public figures, but there is always a story behind the persona. I thought her honesty was quite refreshing in a world where no one admits publicly they sought help with their or that they failed the Bar exam the first time. I don't know that I was a true fan before reading this book, but since reading it, I have become a major fan. I love the way she protected her children from the media while the family was in office, and I liked the way she talked about her family. Definitely worth the time.

  Becoming by Michelle Obama has been a fascinating read and a real Christmas Holiday treat.  It was like sitting down and having a clear and candid talk with a new acquaintance. This was a monumental task as Michelle Obama covered many details of her journey over a large span of time.  Every small step that she took prepared her for her ascent up the ladder to becoming our nation’s first African-American First Lady.  She and her husband, the former President Barack Obama, have made never-to-be-forgotten history that brought many smiles and much pride to so many!

  In my attempts to keep an open mind,  I chose to read “Becoming” because honestly, I was not a Michele Obama fan.  She had always irritated me - but why?  I have the strong belief that you should educate yourself about things you don’t understand.  I am very glad I took the time to read this memoir.I began reading this memoir with some skepticism, thinking the book would be about Barack and his presidency.  It came close a couple of times, but Michele always returned to a story about her, and how the events in her life affected her outlook.  I admire her strength and determination to better herself, and how she could impact other people’s lives.  Not by giving them unattainable promises, but by encouraging and empowering them to make the difference in what they themselves could do.I found that I have a lot of the same beliefs and goals as Michele.  Tradition, family, determination, goals, attitude, perseverance and integrity are only some of the words that can be used to describe “Becoming.”  This book is definitely worth the read.

  This was an enlightening book on several levels.  There are details of the exhausting and sometimes unsavory aspects of running for office.  Michelle makes it clear that the procedure was extremely difficult for her, especially because she herself is such an intelligent, well-spoken person in her own right.  She had to sublimate herself and submit to coaching on what she should and should not say and how she should dress.  She discusses her mistakes openly.Her background, her family, her education are fascinating and go a long way to explaining the type of person she became.I found the choices she made in life, for example, to leave the law and making lots of money to work with non-profits also to reveal much about her character.

  I am so gratefull to Michelle Obama for writing this book with such inborn grace, honesty and humor.  I had tears in my eyes and a full heart for most of the time I soent readimg it.  ı usually rad very fast but I literaaly went slow, one bit at a time so it would not end.Her childhood and her first years with Obama, the way she describes her parents, her friends, her self-questioning, her patience and the lack thereof at times, and her honesty as she does all that is phenomenal.  If I had not listened to her speak about Hilary Clinton just before the final elections, I might have thought that she has someone write this book.  But that soeech had moved me just as much as this book did.I am also impressed that there is nothing ""too much"" or "" too little"" in the book.  ıt does not leave me thinking "" I wish she would have talked about his or that"". It is just right without getting  too emotional or too flat.Bravo to the woman who will always remain the most formidable First Lady in my heart.And please do write the next one too.

  I bough this book for my wife, who loved it and told me as a person who grew up in Chicago and became a lawyer to not miss it.I agree it is a wonderful book but there is a glaring omission that is not an oversight. MS. Obama is far too careful to forget this.  She skips a very important dinner party she and the President attend before he announces his intention to run for president.  It is the dinner party held at the residence of Bill Ahers and his wife Bernadeen Dorn.  For those of us of a certain age we well remember these two and a few others and anarchists who used violence.Each reformed and had a university job or education position.  Still, sitting down with these folks was fodder during the campaign and I wanted to get Ms Obama;s view on it.  She never gave one since she skipped it.  It was not overlooked by the media or Obama opponents.Oddly she also skipped her three years in law school.  After a careful analysis and warm  memories of her life up to law school she just said she got into Harvard and the next chapter she is a lawyer.  What?This may have been edited out for space reasons but it did not feel authentic to me whereas the rest of the book is very authentic.

  Michelle Obama’s book, besides being remarkably open and honest, is well written, humorous at times, and touches repeatedly on our common existence with a tremendous sense of “soul.”  In spite of being a detailed and ordered individual, her most important trait is that she fully realizes, and effectively explains, that a life well lived is nothing more than a process of continually moving towards the light and becoming.  I wish every American would read this wonderful work with an open mind and warm heart.  Thank you, Michelle, for your encouraging and most graceful enlightenment!

  What struck me, more than anything was how much I could relate , to a woman , whose life experience is largely unparalleled. It is most amazing that a woman, who went through so much, and whose adult life was largely thrust under a microscope so powerful, so devastating, could speak in terms that could make a very ordinary person like me feel her pain, her fears, her insecurities, her struggle. It feels like a distant dream when one would look up to the presidential office to be our beacon for intelligence, decency and morality, or at least some combination of those qualities. It is  deep respect, regard and heartfelt thanks that springs to my mind as I close this book. Thanks to this family , who endured so much, who gave so much , who thought so much about this country, all it's citizens and it's future. Thank you for embedding a vision that Americans can look back on fondly,band think of a time when at least momentarily, the country rose above race and elected Barack Obama. Thank you for showing us what grace under fire really means. Thank you for giving your lives and making sacrifices on many levels , as you continue to do for the future of this country. The country will remain in debt of you and your family for this vision for many a time to come. Thank you for becoming.

  First Lady Michelle Obama takes you behind the scenes of the White House and gives you a glimpse of what it's like for a mother who's raising her young daughters under high security and public scrutiny.It was interesting to learn how much she worried about her daughters not having a normal childhood. One very poignant moment in the book was when she wanted to see her oldest daughter play tennis. Not wanting to make a scene with all the Secret Service detail around her, she sat in a limo beside the courts and watched her from afar.This book is full of interesting tidbits about how Mrs. Obama met her husband, and how she had to change from being around her very warm, loving family to being isolated in the White House. Among many of her projects were starting a garden, encouraging children to be healthy, and dedicating her time and energy to helping military families.This is an enjoyable read, chocked full of fascinating information and written with wit and charm.

  Before 2008 I had not really heard anything about the Obamas except that Barack was running for President.  I knew nothing about his wife.  It was only after they moved into the White House hat I became interested in her when she lobbied for a garden.  As an early childhood educator I was pleased at her goal of better nutrition in school lunches and later in encouraging more children to move.Until I read the book I knew nothing about her childhood nor education or about her family.  I was vaguely aware that her mother helped her with the girls at the White House.  This book kept my interest from beginning to end.  I read into the wee small hours which I don’t normally do.  It was fascinating and I learned so much about what life as a President’s wife entails.  Impressive that she made it home to say “Goodnight “ to her daughters even while campaigning.Kudos to Michelle Obama in every phase of her life and on a well-written book.  I highly recommend it.

  This was a great read because it was just so personal. At many times, I forgot that I was reading about such an illustrious, renowned, and accomplished person,....was simply, Michelle. I especially loved reading about Michelle's very endearing experiences in childhood with her beloved family on Euclid Avenue. The first part of the book was my favorite because she described her extended family (including the quirky ones!!), along with, her beloved father, mother, and Craig, her brother. She did a great job in expressing her personal relationship with different family members. She made the Euclid Avenue of her youth sound like a place I would have loved to visit. Am sure I would have heard the piano music coming out of the downstairs apartment. Well written and went straight to my heart! Then the second part of the book really fills in the context for the parts of Michelle's life that I am more aware of, along with the struggles of becoming and being the US first lady, while still making her husband and family her first priority. Also, great perspective on her own professional accomplishments and drive to succeed with the hard fought opportunities that her parents sacrificed to give her. This book is very much in Michelle's own words and much more enjoyable, for that. She is honest in sharing her joys, triumphs, personal and professional struggles, and yes, her mistakes, as well. Predominately thought, it is her tender, loving heart that shines through the most. The book certainly shows the real woman behind the very public persona and why she is such a memorable and beloved to FLOTUS to me and many others. She is a very loyal, loving, and a fierce foe, when protecting her family, friends, the causes she champions, and subsequently, the millions of Americans represented by those causes. A very good read. Loved the earnest first person delivery. Felt like she was talking right to me. I will definitely read again, especially to visit Euclid Avenue and the early years at home with her family. You will learn about her amazingly hard won education and professional life that very much sets her apart, but all and still, it is her faithfulness, love, and loyalty that will stick with you, long after the book is finished. It seemed clear that in choosing Michelle for a spouse, President Obama made one of the wisest choices of his life.

  Michelle tells HER story well. She describes her life very detailed, tells the reader about her fears, her troubles, ups and downs, hers - and this of her family. She is well spoken and this totally reflects in her book. I thought I would know a lot about her, the President and her children because the press constantly release so many details. But this book truly lets you look behind the scene, behind all the glamour - gives you a glimpse of how much pressure it can be to live in the White House. I truly love how she talks about her doubts when Barack wanted to run for president, how this all effected her and her family. This book made me laugh, It made me think deeper, it helped me understand and reflect. I loved the book. However,  sometimes I had the impression that M. tried to excuse certain things that happened in the past. No excuses necessary in my opinion - one is not born into the role of the First Lady - you need to earn this Titel and you need to navigate through it. I loved the audio book even more than the book.

  I choose five stars because even though the material was somewhat familiar , it was written in such a way that I was excited to go from page to page with great anticipation ! What I liked most about this book was the very personal girlfriend- like tone that allowed me to get deeply immersed in almost every page . I think fans of Michelle Obama will love this book and be glad she shared her personal story with us ! A great fast read ! Five stars all the way !

  I usually don’t leave reviews unless a book really moves me and thus book definitely did! As an AA woman this book was a “MUST READ” but it should be required reading for all to show there is no limit to what one can achieve. Also that we are more than the stereotypes that “they” place on us. This book gave more insight into the phenomenal woman that we all witnessed handle the scrutiny of the world with poise and grace.

  There is so much more to Michelle Obama than her reign as FLOTUS and what has been visible to us over the last twelve years.  Using her own background as a catalyst, Michelle has used her time in this world to give back and to help all children believe that they can become anything they want through education and perseverance.  I enjoyed hearing her voice in this story.  I could feel her emotions.  And I could see how important parents can be in the lives of their children, both in Michelle and Barack's upbringings as well as the way this couple raised their children.  This book is not finished.  I know Michelle will continue to inspire us even if not on a political stage.  There will be more chapters to come, and I look forward to the future because of the Obamas.

  So extremely well written.  This isn't a political book.  It's about a wife, mother, daughter, with insights into the process of running for election & living in the snow globe of the White House.  So many lovely stories about her life before & after Barack.  It's real.  It's honest.  It's beautiful.

  i chose this book because i have been an admirer of first lady michelle obama for a while. i did think it a relatively light version of her life and experience in the white house and i would have preferred more depth to her insights. it seemed to me that there were quite a few thinly veiled pokes at the current president, which i both understand and agree with. i would recommend this book to young women seeking a female mentor whom they can emulate. i think she has a lot more to say and would love for her to write another book that digs deeper.

  Ms. Obama has written a very personal story of her life and relates what it is to be black and female in the United States. Even with her intellectual gifts and hard work, it is a difficult life in her country and a fragile existence. I was moved by her efforts to improve the potential futures of the girls in subsequent generations. I would recommend the book to anyone with an interest in culture of black America.

  I have no words to describe how well this book has been written. It felt like she was telling me the story one-one. I am extremely inspired by how ordinary Michelle's life was yet she rose to such a position and touched so many lives. Her deep caring nature and her efforts to better peoples' lives made me realize that not all politicians have bad intentions. Just like her, I have never liked politics (especially being born and brought up in Kenya).Despite the diverse challenges she faced, I am in awe of how much she tried to do her best as a mother and a wife. This book gave me a a very close range view of how difficult a country's leader's life can be and how it impacts everyone around them.I am not a follower of American politics but I now have profound respect for the Obamas as I admire the passion that drove them to bring reforms. We hope to have many such leaders globally!

  Michelle Obama comes across in her book Becoming as so very authentic. I grew up in small-town northern California, born to white college educated parents. Yet, I identified with Michelle’s journey more than I can say. This speaks to her comments about campaigning in Iowa. She said it wasn’t about differences, it was about similarities, people trying to do there best for themselves and their families. I loved hearing about the challenges as well as the successes. I really didn’t want the book to end!Thank you for setting such a great example, thank you for all you’ve done and continue to do, and thank you for sharing your experiences that others may be inspired to keep showing up and doing their best too.

  I was caught up in her story from the very beginning because it was such an American story.  From  salt of the earth parents and a loving extended family Michelle brought values to the Whit House we could all recognize, honor, honesty humor, integrity, bravery and a love and devotion to family we all could understand and embrace.She reminded me it was our collective job to see to the well being of all the children and our shared  responsibility to nurture and protect our girls.  I loved how much she loved us as her fellow Americans and want her to know I loved them back.

  This book is exceptional on so many levels.  It is extremely readable, engaging and speaks to issues familiar  to all of us regardless of gender, ethnicity or socio-economic background.  That isn’t to minimize the wonderful way Michelle verbalizes the special roadblocks and feelings of exclusion faced by individuals of color (and other ethnic groups).  Her ability to give voice to the struggles of women, in general, and within a marriage from a non threatening or “victimized” position is impressive.  There’s no good or bad guy, instead a process of self awareness, necessary negotiation and commitment by both spouses.  As a clinical social worker engaged in marital counseling for over 45 years, I was impressed by her even handed presentation.This is not a political book.  It is a wonderful book about a bright, determined, caring woman who has career ambitions and a desire to be a highly involved mother who happens to be very politically identifiable.

It provides great insights on both the ""dirty"" politics, the still existing racial bias/stereotyping and the struggle of ""becoming"" something other than what society ""dictates"".Poignant descriptions of family members, neighborhoods, schools, and the happenings that shaped the first family provide a clear understanding of the ""character"",  conflicts, and challenges the Obama's faced as young people, through their marriage, all the way through the end of their service as First Family.

She expresses her  personal doubts and fears in regard to a living a public life as well as her fears for the physical safety of her family.  She also expresses the joys of their position, the ways in which her life changed when she met Barack and they fell in love, married and started a family while pursuing their careers.  She's an intelligent, compassionate, and passionate woman who knows her strengths and shares her insights.  I liked her as First Lady, I respect her as a writer who says what she thinks and feels and whose company you enjoy in the process.

I am ashamed at the country I live in and love can so callously sideline other human beings because of their skin color. The lengths Michelle Obama had to go to succeed in a white world is mind boggling, but I am so glad she did. I hope that the work the Obamas did to promote women and diversity do not get totally flushed down the toilet of the current administration. I am looking forward to their light shining again.

I fell I love with her all over again. I cried tears of joy, empathy or sadness in nearly every chapter.As a working mother, her openness about her struggles with balance and working mom guilt resonated deeply with me.Her love for Barrack, her daughters, her family and America is genuine and raw. She tells her story with a humbleness that few possess.I found myself wanting to keep listening to hear the full story but dreading the final words.

I've liked and admired her as First Lady, but reading her story brought my respect and adoration of her and her husband to a whole new level, while it gave me deeper insight on the challenges that each of them faced throughout their lives and the perseverance it has taken to live and grow and succeed throughout each step along the way. I admire their love of children--all children--and the devotion to raising their own.

  Michelle Obama told her story with warmth and intelligence.  She embodies two wonderful personality traits, that are sometimes mutually exclusive.  By nature, she’s a Nike woman:  Just Do It!!  Yet she’s outgoing and open to new ways of thinking, unafraid to take a critical look at herself, and make adjustments by listening to her heart and her head, and by seeking advice from good mentors.Her story of meeting Barack Obama was delightful.  Loved the engagement ring scenario!  Their natures are quite disparate, yet they learn from one another and complement each other.Becoming is an apt title.  Michelle is still becoming, and inspires her readers to do the same.

  I couldn't wait to purchase the hard copy so I got the Kindle version as soon as it came out (I live outside of the US so I couldn't wait for delivery).  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because I love Michelle Obama and was anxious to read about her life before the White House.  However, I initially thought the first section of the book was not as interesting as the other two sections.  But when I got to those sections, I realized it was necessary for us as readers to know about her upbringing in order to fully understand how she was able to accomplish what she did academically and socially.  She is truly an inspiration to me as a woman and I know she is to many others young girls and women.  What she has accomplished in her life was an amazing feat.  And what she was able to accomplish while in the White House was phenomenal!!!LS

  How can anyone write a cynical review about this book? We need to walk a mile in Michell’s shoes before anyone Says anything! How vulnerable are humans, when they come into power? Michelle Obama is fully human, fully cognizant of her place in the destiny of this country, fully indignant at human suffering and fully integrated as a human personality. I am three-fourths of the way through Becoming and I don’t want it to end. I am going to re-read it and study her observations and internalize them. She has lessons for everyone. Her bluntness, candor, transcendent grace, humility, self-awareness give hope that, as a country, as interrelated beings, political or not, we are all in this living together. Democrat, Republican, independent—we have to get along and not spew hatred. This is a book to keep, a commentary on a rare period in history where barriers were broken, precedents were set and the bar, raised. Michelle, I salute you. You are one strong lady and the pride of this country.

  How can anyone write a cynical review about this book? We need to walk a mile in Michell’s shoes before anyone Says anything! How vulnerable are humans, when they come into power? Michelle Obama is fully human, fully cognizant of her place in the destiny of this country, fully indignant at human suffering and fully integrated as a human personality. I am three-fourths of the way through Becoming and I don’t want it to end. I am going to re-read it and study her observations and internalize them. She has lessons for everyone.

  Michelle Obama’s storytelling talents are without parallel.  I would suggest reading the book first, and then I would also highly recommend purchasing the Audible version of this book.  Read by the author herself (unabridged), you’ll feel as though Michelle Obama were just sitting with you in your home, casually chatting with heartfelt sincerity about her lifetime experiences and her introspective ponderings about them. I must have listened to the Audible version AT LEAST ten times, without exaggeration, either in the car or at home.What a thoroughly delightful book brought to life with the warmth and sincerity of a rich, melodic voice that lends humility yet confidence in appreciating her own life’s journey.

  I am enjoying reading this book. It is very honest and well written account of her life. It is fact based and moved me to tears in some places. It appears to portray her family as real with problems and solutions and love. I even liked the pictures included of people who were important in her life and helped her ""become"" who she is. this was worth the time and I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in biographies and Michelle Obama! It is on my Christmas list for friends who do not already have it.

  I. Love. This. Woman! I love that she is always herself. Throughout the book, I could hear her voice, even though I didn’t have the audiobook. She is just as real and genuine as she seemed all throughout the presidency. I loved that she was so open about the inner workings of the White House. I found it fascinating to learn about all of the detail of protecting and looking out for the president and the first family. As expected, this was a great read by a powerful woman who is down to earth and believes in her obligation and opportunity to help others be just as great as she is.

  Enjoyed learning more about First Lady Michele, her family, schooling and marriage to President Obama. She takes us on a candid journey and you will learn lots about who she has become. Loved the strong bond of love she discusses toward her family, children and husband. Don't miss this opportunity to read a very informative book. I've advised younger readers who have the book to use websites to assist them in pronouncing/understanding vocabulary that may be unfamiliar. My hubby has lots of books, magazines and other readings scattered in tidy rooms to my dismay. Reading President Obama's like behavior helps me understand perhaps its a ""man thing"".

  This story is about Michelle’s journey into politics with her husband, Barack.  She was the first African American First Lady and felt the pressure of that responsibility.  She showed how her leadership focused on children’s health and diet through her beautiful garden.Michelle spoke to many young Black students and made arrangements for them to witness the possibilities that lie ahead for them.  I believe every female Middle School and High School student should read this book.  Also it should be included in Women’s Studies Courses. Men who are allies to women should read this book too. Thank you Michelle for undertaking this project!

  I love memoirs, the chance to get into someone’s head and life, and this one is really well written. It is a wonderful portrait of growing up in a changing neighborhood, a beautiful picture of good parenting. It is fascinating to watch her personal search for a fulfilling career and then to get a sense of the difficulties of life in the White House fishbowl. Bonus: after reading this I feel better about my own busy life. I am thankful my husband isn’t called to a career where he is gone for days or months at a time. I am thankful that I control my schedule; I don’t have dozens of people planning for me, scheduling me, briefing me. People don’t analyze and twist my every expression. At least I get paid for the work I do . What is it like to become a symbol? Not very comfortable.

  This is a remarkable autobiography. I have seldom read one so honest. From the descriptions of what goes on behind closed doors at the White House, to the stories from growing up from a child to a fully realized woman, Michelle Obama leaves nothing on the table. While reading this book, I felt honored, honored to be allowed into a world both wonderful and fascinating, as well as heartbreaking and terrifying. The book is historically accurate as well as entertaining and revealed much about the thinking behind decisions that are made during campaigns. Whatever your background you will appreciate this book. I highly recommend this book to everyone.

  As with all political memoirs, people are going to judge this book by its cover. There are those writing reviews that want to dismiss it based on principle. I appreciate that, but also feel the need to provide a counterbalance.This is not a memoir about politics per se; it’s not a platform for Michelle to use in a campaign or to bring in a bunch of money. (According to Publisher's Weekly, she and Barack already received a $65 million dollar advance that they likely won't 'earn out' of - meaning there's no more money to be had here. They'd have to sell more books that you can imagine to do that.)Becoming is a story about sacrifice. The sacrifices Michelle’s grandparents and parents made for her and her brother, the sacrifices Barack made for his country, the sacrifices Michelle and their daughters made for him. It’s the human-view of the Obama Whitehouse.When it comes to political figures and celebrities, we are quick to dehumanize. We forget that behind every campaign dream, every policy change, every speech, every declaration of war - there are hard working human beings, pushing themselves to make the right moves. These are people who’ve had heartbreak, who are unsure of themselves, who get upset when they are criticized on Twitter.Sacrifice is a big and powerful word, one that often is tied to the negative aspects of our experiences. We think of sacrifice as something we choose out of spite. And often times that’s true. But not in this story. Not completely, anyway. For every sacrifice made in Michelle Obama’s journey to FLOTUS - was one made out of a deep sense of purpose. We all have something to learn from that.This is a beautiful story that helps us reconnect to the humanity in politics. It reminds us that people are not cogs or talking heads; people are people.Michelle’s memoir will be read for generations. It’s by the first ever memoir by the first ever black First Lady of the United States. Let that sink in a little. Buy a copy and curl up. I don't think you will regret it.[PS - This book is 400+ pages long, which means most people won't read it all the way through. Especially those who've received it as a gift this year. Keep that in mind as you continue scrolling through reviews.]

  I loved, loved, LOVED this book!! Let me first say that until the last 8-9 months of the Obama's time in the White House, I was not a fan. It had nothing to do with bigotry of a racial sort, it was a fear based bigotry of my lifelong Republican roots. Roots that said in essence, ""I worked hard for what I have and I'm not sharing that with people who I don't know"". My wake up moment came when Donald Trump won the nomination for the Republican Party. If this was the kind of person the Party was putting forward, I was done. I began to watch Michelle and President Obama through a lens of greatly appreciating their grace and compassion extended to everyone whom too many in our country deemed less-than, or insignificant.I am blessed to actually love being proved wrong when it comes to over turning long held beliefs when faced with evidence to the contrary. Even though I became a fan of the Obama's before their time in the White House was over, this book changed my perspective on their entire tenure and for that, I'm grateful to have been proven wrong, once again.Thank you Michelle Obama for letting me get to know you. You folks are representative of what makes this country great, not the current political climate.

  This book is the voice of a woman bo th h ordinary and extraordinary who has chosen to shine a light on all the good she witnessed in her tenure as First Lady. Her writing style is as direct and unassuming as she appeared to us on stage. Her story is at times laugh out loud funny but more often heartbreaking as she describes her encounters with ordinary Americans, service people and their families and victims of gun violence. For someone like me, who has a hard time with rude drivers on the freeway, the way she thinks and lives is as rare and refined as a saint or as Nelson Mandela, the man she said was her inspiration. To women everywhere, no matter what race, religion or culture, I say read this book. You will feel uplifted and inspired in your own life and encouraged too because Mrs. Obama makes you feel empowered. Simply put, her message is one of optimism and hope.

  I bought this book because I thought it would be interesting to learn about the President's wife.  I did not expect to love it:  after all, it is an autobiography.  But Michelle Obama is an excellent writer.  Her words flow.  Her personality comes through loud and clear.  She is speculative. She is not afraid to address tough topics, including her reluctance to have Barack go into politics.  She explains some of her actions and words, noting that she had been misquoted  or words were out of context at times (remember the report of her being most proud of America).  She is a success in spite of growing up on the wrong side of the tracks in Chicago.  Part of that is her own smarts, her drive, her hard work, her parents, but she acknowledges that many good people mentored her, encouraged her, helped her.  In turn, she urges all of us to do the same with those younger than we are.As I said, I loved this book.

  I saw Michelle Obama speak in Pittsburgh when Hillary Rodham Clinton was running for office. Her positive, dynamic appeal to be the best we can be, resounded with me then as it does today when I finished her book. Most of what she wrote about that took place in her White House years was familiar to me, so it was her prior story and that of her family’s that I found most compelling. I know she does not want to go into politics and it is a nasty arena these days on both sides. Still I hope whoever is the next president, will find a way to bring a positive joining to both parties.  “When they go low, we go high.” May that spirit return to our nation.

I have always been an admirer of hers, but after reading this memoir, can say that she is a sister and friend. I felt like she was writing it specifically to me as an encouragement and affiliation .

  Mrs. Obama steps out quickly to embrace our thoughts and emotions with carefully crafted stories about her roots. In doing so, she envelops us into her arms; we can not let go, even when the lights are turned out.This is a thoughtful book - one which grew from emotions as tired as a magazine in a beauty shop, and yet as  buoyant as a warm, cinnamon bun. This is a book that deserves highlighting. There are countless, memorable lines.Thanks for your memories, Mrs. Obama.

  Michelle gives us the detail, behind the scenes look what of what it is like to live in the White House.  I found that fascinating.  Also sobering what goes on the good and bad in politics.  I found her life story very inspiring coming from a black middle class family and how love and support not only kept her on the right track to blossom but the chance encounters, one being meeting her husband, and the invisible forces of life and of course hardwork and dedication that  propelled Barrack and his wife and family to represent America with new positive ideas in a time our country needed it most.  I felt this to be a very proud moment in our history to witness Barrack get sworn in as our first black President.  Michelle's story brought me back to that moment and more so.  At times I felt tears and other times I  laughed outloud.  This book will move you, make you think, inspire you to grow, and how to raise a healthy family.  They both did a lot of good for our country.  Mahalo.

  Michelle Obama is a good story teller. As she tells her story,  keeps her eye on the  events and the intentions, as only she can know them and is totally engaging.  You seem to get to know her as you continue reading.  Her circle of friends - of women friends - are also inspiring, as is her commitment  to, her reliance on and her trust of those friends.  She explores many emotions and we never lose her even as we learn how power her sense of loss, her elation, her pride might be, the story keeps on unfolding.

  I loved this book.  Mrs Obama is a wonderful story teller.  I have known about all of her amazing accomplishments and wanted to know what influenced her most.  She had parents that I found myself wishing I had had.  That’s sad to say but really true.  She was very determined to study and work very hard.  She had gotten her degrees from Columbia University and Princeton, and worked in a prestigious law firm when Barack walked in.  I love the behind the scene story of their lives in the White House, and I now have a greater appreciation for the initiatives she devoted her time to as First Lady.I’ve already leant my copy to a friend who was interested in reading her story.  It’s now on my top ten favorite books list.

Her journey and her outstanding thoughtfulness in all that she faced and all that she undertook is inspiring, remarkable and incredibly moving.  A woman and a book for the ages!!  Truly outstanding!

  This book was not just Michelle Becoming, but it was me Becoming, my friends and neighbors and classmates that grew up with me in Palmetto, a migrant town in Florida.  Many who was able to ride up out of the tomato fields through education to have a dream realized life. We, like Michelle, was encouraged to get an education so that we could Become whatever we wanted to in kife. Pre-civil rights when it was had to see the reality of what we were told we could Become. But we did it just like Michelle outlined her journey, we know it to be a real journey and an uphill battle and struggle. Thank you for sharing so that our next generation can see and overcome some of the same road blocks we faced.  Thank you for sharing how family can alter our Destiny as a positive influence. So many of this generation is missing this component of Becoming but Michelle pointed out in this book how important it is to be influential to those who are missing family.This is an excellent overview of the first African-American family in the White House. I'm glad I was able to experience it and look forward to the next generation's occupying the residence.

  Becoming, by Michelle Obama, is one of the most intensely interesting books that I've ever read, and I read a lot.  Not only her sense of humor, but her willingness to let us into her thoughts and feelings makes it a stand-out.  The telling never lags, and is not political, as some might expect.  It just gives you a whole new look at the kinds of things that have affected her life.  I gave it to everybody I could last Christmas, but Amazon only let me buy a certain number of them.  Have you ever heard of a book that you couldn't order all the copies you wanted?  That's how popular it is!  This is the book that I would most recommend to everyone.

  My husband and I are reading this book aloud and it is so very readable and easy to relate to.  Michelle starts with her earliest childhood memories sharing the love and commitment to family in the atmosphere in which she was raised.  We experience her joys and frustrations relating to her education, relationships, career choices and mothering.  Her love for her husband and children is palpable (as is her distaste for politics).  This is simply the story of Michelle Obama becoming more herself at every stage of her life shaped by instilled values and the experiences she has and is encountering that change her a bit each time.

  I don't normally give 5 stars but I did because it allowed us to see into lives of a president and first lady, there are great advantages but sobering sacrifices. You get to see a glimpse of what mind set you have to take on these challenges,  and to continue pursuing your goals despite the challenges.  With all these entertaining stories from youthful days to the end of her days in WH  it's really about those four words Are you good enough which she have always questioned herself over the years (as said in the book) which I believe she answered in the way she carried herself with the grace and honesty of who she is and where she is coming from. I like what her mother said about her and brother - they are no different than anyone else. And think that is message summed in a few sentences to anyone who reads this book. You are good enough, not to be posed as a question but as a statement because they are no different from anyone else, you are not different from anyone.  Encouraging, motivating, inspiring, funny, entertaining, informative and beautifully written.

  This was easily my favorite book I have read in a long time and I've read some remarkable books. I've always liked Michelle Obama but I didn't know just how likable and amazing she is until reading this book. Her storytelling is outstanding. Loved all the anecdotes - many of which have nothing to do with politics at all. The page when she first meets Obama sends a chill knowing what's to come. This book is inspiring in the best way, not just for the rise from the south side of Chicago to the White House, but her perspective as a woman, a minority, and as a working mother who never stopped worrying about her kids and the balance of work and life.

  This book is a page turner! The reader gets a front row view of Mrs.Obama's childhood, adolescence, collegiate experience, professional career, dating history with Mr. Obama, motherhood, and emergence into the political world. The reader gets to hear  her hopes, aspirations, fears, insecurities and the ultimate unfolding of her self confidence. Amazingly, Mrs. Obama speaks the words that best capture so many unsettling and hard to grasp realities of politics, minority status, gun violence, health epidemics, and disparities. Yet, she conveys a wonderful optimism about the spirit of America, change promoted by collective community action, and openness to look for sameness rather than differences. Becoming is a must read! You'll feel motivated, encouraged and hopeful after finishing this book!

  When I was a young adult I found that I actually lived only a few blocks from Mrs. Obama in South Chicago. Five other of my friends, in our late teens/early 20s, rented a brownstone for 4 months from a professor who taught at the University of Chicago the summer/fall of 1967. It is an area of normally fine beaches, wonderful museums and great theaters. However, that summer a fish by the name of the Alewife died by the millions in Lake Michigan and washed up on the shores, providing the city with the stench of dead fish. Cannot to this day eat fish! Oh well, we still had a good time. Hard to keep 6 young women working their first jobs down and out!

I owe it to myself to be the best me I can be without shattering another's dream.We all seek love, respect, security, a sense of purpose, and above all to matter. To be heard. To have a voice.I am inspired and so humbled by Mrs Obama's willingness to  take us through her epic journey.

  From a tiny apartment on the Southside of Chicago in a house owned by her great-aunt, to Ivy League schools, Princeton and Harvard Law, from a prestigious law firm to the CEO of community outreach organizations and a hospital vice president in charge of reaching out to underserved populations, to the White House as First Lady, Michele Obama tells of her angst, her happiest times, her fears, and opens her heart and mind to the American public!  It is an awesome work, spellbinding, and bingeworthy.  I won’t even try to highlight any particular points because her “voice” is absolutely fantastic!  I would only spoil it for you.

  It is a true pleasure to read an autobiographical  sketch that is so well written.  Mrs. Obama is most obviously an intelligent woman who is also blessed with a great deal of common sense.  The story of her early years clearly demonstrates what family values brought to the fore in later life.  Most amusing, however, were her encounters with some of the security demands made on her and her daughters, and perhaps better said her family unit--including the President--in the White House.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially for reading and discussion by high school students who may be searching for their place in the world.

She undoubtedly is a person with superior intelligence coupled with incredible feelings for her fellow man.  She is honest and sincere about everything she discusses and listens to advise and adjusts accordingly. I think it will be very difficult to find  another First Lady that can fill her shoes.

Michelle and her husband are my heros for all they accomplished in the White House and he could have done SO much more if the Republicans compromized. They both are so open, loving and sharing, I've always felt I could just walk up and hug them.  I liked her personal views and experiences on race inequality as I was raised on the north side of the city in a white environment but their was never prejudice in my home. Ive always wanted the true feelings of black people and they both have inspired people of their race  to open up and share...,I'm SO ashamed of my race for keeping racism  alive and cant believe how shallow they are .... Trump is the devil himself making everything worse and we despise him God bless you, Michelle....I really look forward to more books by you and your husband.  You are true inspiration to me and your mother is awesome!

  I found the autobiographical pre-Barack portion of the book to be a little too sweet. I can imagine for Michelle Obama reliving and writing about those days was a personal joy, but not nearly so interesting to me as the time after meeting Barack. I understand a critical part of her message is based on knowing where she came from, I just think it could have been more concise. I was fascinated by her White House years -- the challenges of parenting in a fish bowl and the unfolding of her FLOTUS programs. I appreciate her candor in mentions of Donald Trump. I finished the book inspired, confident that even at 80 years old, I still have something to offer -- I can mentor and encourage the young women in my family and in my life.

  I think we all can relate to Michelle. She is so inspiring and I  so wanted to get into her mind and learn what is really like living in the White House and campaigning with her husband.  I related to her need to achieve to find the best job, attend the best schools but in the end it was not really following her passion and leaving her fulfilled.  She's honest about how brutal politics is and why she wants no part of it, and even when she is honest about her feeling for Trump it was done in the most classy way.  I plan to see her book tour this year and I can't wait. If you love Michelle, you'll love this book.

  This was my favorite book of 2019. I learned so much about Michelle Obama and the Obama administration. It was amazing to learn about her childhood and what brought her to where she is today. She is so inspiring and makes me hopeful for what this country can be if we can get back to being kind and descent to one another and not worrying about race, gender or party lines. I give this book 5 stars and think everyone should read it and take it's message to heart.

  Michelle Obama writes the way she speaks. She has a casual tone and a no nonsense attitude that keeps you interested in every word. I liked how she takes us on a journey from growing up on the south side of Chicago to spending 8 years in the White House. Her message is one of hope for the younger generation, but she doesn’t preach it, just shows how we can keep on growing.

  I smiled, I cried, I fell in love. I liked the honesty about the family dynamics, work and political struggles and triumphs. ""Becoming Me "" started off a little slow paced for me but a necessary part of the story to prepare the reader to understand ""Becoming Us"". A story about balance; balancing personal values and work values, family life and political life. A story about finding one’s voice and maintaining one’s voice. A story about being authentic. An intriguing and inspiring story, well worth reading.

  Michelle Obama, in my opinion, is one of the greatest First Ladies the USA was ever honored to have. She is a superwoman who generally cares about people, especially children. She worked hard to protect her children, support her husband and accomplish so many things to help people. It was really interesting walking in her shoes. Her story was very compelling from where she came from to where she is today. It was not a page turner, but a memoir of a great woman. I can’t wait to see what more she will do for our world. We need people like her.

  Becoming by Michelle Obama will inspire you to think about who you want to become, no matter your beginning & no matter your (or others) perception of how your life will ultimately end. Becoming is much bigger than that. It's potential in you, in other's, and leaning toward an uncommon life because you can choose that. Develop that. Grow into that. ""Become"" that unique person only you can reach for.  Michelle Obama takes us on a journey to ""go high"" - to aspire to achieve , and take others with us. In doing so,  our world is a better place because of our endeavors. We ""become"" better people because of it. Becoming is heartfelt, beautifully written, personal. It calls us to value ourselves, one another,  & subsequently build a better world. And who does not want to become someone who takes part in that adventure!

  It’s a decent read but nothing particularly enlightening or exciting.  I generally don’t like autobiographies and this kind of confirms my own preference.  I am critical of people when reflecting upon their life, apply too much meaning after the fact to probably thoughtless actions of a child.  Don’t get me wrong; I love the Obamas. But the reciting of a list or accomplishments feels too self-congratulating to me and also inflating. A lot of the initiatives - did they really have any lasting impacts? I doubt it.  Not that she was not a great FLOTUS, but I feel that some of these initiatives, without regulatory changes, don’t have lasting impacts.  Anyway, this critique is only on the book, not on Michelle Obama as a person or as the FLOTUS.

  Let me start by saying the beginning was a little slow for me, but it was so necessary to have the back story for what it truly meant to become Michelle Obama. It is a must read for all women of all backgrounds. You can find a piece of you in the pages or motivation for your journey.  I am an educator and a president of a non profit. I chose to use my Christmas break reading this book. Some of my teachers and friends are having a book club meeting to explore the various themes and nuggets tucked in the pages of this book. Teacher salaries don’t lend itself to purchasing the tickets to join the book tour, but we can participate at a grassroots level by holding our own discussions. The Obamas gave a lot to show the world the best of us and not the exception but what a lot of our families look and feel like. They did it with the dignity and class that my grandmother always expected from all of us. This book gives you enough information to understand the sacrifice and know that it deserves for the benefits to outweigh the cost. That can happen if we continue to support and do the work described in these pages. “Let’sMove in more ways than one!

Mrs. Obama invites the reader into her life and into her living rooms as she moves from Euclid Avenue on the south side of Chicago to the White House. Her powerful story, vulnerability, humor and strong emotion read as if she is sharing an afternoon teatime with the reader who opens her book.Her perspectives on education, romance, becoming a wife and mother, politics, and wearing the mantle of First Lady will inspire. The tribute she pays to her own mother shows a grace-filled honor paid to the woman who set her daughter on the path to make American history. Every word is riveting.Thank you, Mrs. Obama.

  I’m not finished reading the book yet but I enjoy the stories of growing up, her family and meeting her husband. She is candid and she is confident with herself. She is down to earth, unashamed of not growing up wealthy, and she is proud of her parents and realizes how much strength she has gotten through their example. She understands the significance of having been the First Lady, and she has contributed much to Country. She is beautiful of course and she has withstood the hatefulness of some of her critics. She has earned the respect of many people. I look forward to reading the rest of the book, and I hope that someday I will have an opportunity to meet her (and her husband). I did see the President when he came to my hometown as a candidate in 2008, and I watched him make his pivotal speech as a Senator. Both of them are excellent speakers and writers.

You always feel as you read her book that she wanted to live a meaningful life full of love for her family. After the births of her daughter Sasha and Malia, the book is full of stories about them growing up in the White House and becoming young adults in extraordinary circumstances. This is a rare look behind the scenes at a remarkable family and an amazing life.

In my mind I always visioned it would all be peaches and cream. Thank you for the the truth. For all those readers do not rush through this book.

In my mind I always visioned it would all be peaches and cream. Thank you for the the truth. For all those readers do not rush through this book. Take the time to read every syllable, adjectives, verb and pronoun. I found myself rereading paragraphs to try and get an understanding of what she was trying to tell me. And when I finally did it was wonderful. I also gave to other books as a Christmas gift to my girlfriends. And we'll be passing this one down to my daughter. I say thank you to her again.

  Becoming is a honest and energizing book.  Like so many of us, Michelle lives to find who she is.  She is inspiring in that she came from a less than desirable locale, leaving it only physically with education.  Inspiring because she left it by taking advantage of public education.  More than that, her heart never left the area in Chicago where she hung her hopes.  Michelle Obama is rooted in Chicago, sprouted through her education and career choices and is still sprouting branches that flower insight, hope, and encouragement to anyone ready to face their place in an ever changing world.

  Michelle Obama's candor and authenticity made this book both easy to read and inspirational. I thought it was unusual for a First Lady to have been so open about her thoughts, emotions, and opinions  - shedding light to an otherwise closed off world and bringing people to understand her own vulnerabilities as a human being. What i appreciated the most was how consistent her tone was throughout the book - I felt that her stories were told lovingly and with a goal to reach out to people, connect, and relate, rather than to propagate any specific political view. The stories show her unwavering optimism, commitment to humanity, and a genuine dedication to inspire those around her with worldly values - Michelle, what a strong woman! I only hope Michelle Obama would publish more books so she can continue to inspire and share the warmth of her love for this world and humanity!A must read for anyone who wants to leave feeling hopeful, warm, and optimistic about the day in age we live in. Thank you Michelle for making me believe that goodness, fairness, and generosity still exist in the world of politics we are experiencing today!

  Michelle provided an engaging insight into the life of an ordinary girl (next door woman) who became extraordinary! It was fascinating to watch her evolve from a box checker (her words) to a world leader, innovator and thinker despite the pressures of racism she confronted. Our book club talked about this book for a long time, beyond our usual book club discussion. I highly recommend this book to any person interested in Becoming their best self.

  I really enjoyed reading this book.  Michelle Obama is a great story teller. She walks the reader through her childhood in Chicago and paints a vivid picture of her early experiences, the family that impacted her and the doubts and insecurities that would drive her all her life.I gave it 4 stars because it seems to run out of steam along the last few chapters and feels rushed to an ending. I would have loved to see the same detail on the last aspects of the book (her life in the White House) as she painted in her early childhood.  However, overall, wonderful read and gives you great insight into her life, family, marriage, and the many challenges she navigated along the way.

  I had no clue what I was getting into when I started reading this. The memoir is refreshingly  honest and heart-felt, giving an intimate look into her hopes & fears, vivid flashbacks into her childhood and connecting throughout the book to these core events and people who she credits for who and where sshe ended up. Revealing and fascinating nuance brought to President Obama and her family and friends that makes you feel like you almost know them personslly. This book is so REAL and entertaining, a page-turner too, providing an uplifting read. Thanks to her philosophy on life and her candour, Becoming reinforces that women are valuable and bright and strong, and yet we don't have to be perfect. Women of color please read this and start leading - we need more Michelle Obama's in this world!!!Mrs. Obama Thank you for inspiring me, a young woman to pursue community organizing and gift White supremacy in my own circles in the Bay Area and San Diego. Your book is outstanding, thank you for this gift of vulnerability.

  Well written book, plus fascinating life story.Some places feels sketchy and superficial tho (at least for me), maybe because I’m living in my own bulb 💡 far away from America-world :) OR maybe because she is “the First Lady” & it’s forever!I love the title “Becoming” and structure the author used. It goes thru the whole book as a gold line: becoming isn’t about arriving somewhere, it is a MOTION, process/evolving with no end. And this girl never stops!Enjoyed reading about childhood and family stories.The most interesting info - about differences (as personalities/character/likes) with Barack. But still...they stayed together, with each year stronger than ever. Love conquers everything “wink”!

  I absolutely loved this book.  I read it on Kindle, so if there were pictures in the paper book, I didn't have them, but the writing and recounting the details of her life were so vivid, you don't need pictures.  In these horrible, stressful times we're  living in the USA now (beginning 2017 and on, and on, and on), it was such a welcome return to real people, nice people, in fact, people like my family, was a big part of my enjoyment reading her story.  If only all people in the news, in all the country, in all the world, could be as eloquent, wise, good, and grounded as Michelle and Barack Obama, . .. . think of what a great life this would be.

The trolls hired to spam these reviews motivated me even more not only to purchase one to read, but to purchase several more as gifts. America will survive this 2016-2020 stain.

  It's a lovely book.  The first section on her childhood in south Chicago is particularly moving.  I'm impressed with the extent to which she thought through her role as first lady and concentrated so heavily on providing opportunities for women and children.  The differences between her family expectations and her husband's and how she worked at bridging them are admirable.  Her mother claimed that Michelle and her brother were not unusual--that there were many other children just as gifted.  It's hard to believe because Michelle's gifts are remarkable.

  I loved reading this book because it felt I got to know the Obamas on a personal level.  It was so endearing to read about how Michelle and Barack met and started dating, how he proposed, how their girls took to the roller coaster of being First Children, etc.  I was so glad that Michelle also wrote about the difficulties of being a successful woman who expects equality and partnership and how she came to terms with a role that expects you to smile and support your husband's dreams and successes, and how they navigated through that and made it out the other side.  It felt like a really human and real story of two ordinary people who ended up leading extraordinary lives.

Hence, this is why the book is so long.  I read it because all of my book reading friends told me I had to check it out.  So, I did.  I enjoyed it but honestly, it could have been 2/3rds of its length.  Really.If you are an Obama fan, you should definitely read this book.  And, it definitely is historical in my opinion...so that alone is a good enough reason to read it, even though I have never been a fan of much history (sorry).

  I initially thought the book was about the things that happened in the White House. Anyway, I loved this book. She was so candid and I especially loved that. You can tell she is very down to earth, and her writing skills are remarkable. While reading certain parts I would get the chills. The words make you think you are actually experiencing what she was trying to get across yourself. The fact that she kept it real about how she felt was everything to me. Most people would not be so open for fear of what others would think. Will definitely buy other books that she has written.

  Michelle is the real deal. It was heart warming to read of her humble upbringing and the love of her family. Michelle worked hard to get good grades, to find her way through racism and struggle. Her can do spirit and reluctant decision to embrace her husband's political trajectory meant she had to give up her VP position with 22 staff in order to support her husband's political path. The rest we know from her as First Lady but all that came before is a story worth reading.

  One of my favorite passages in this book comes toward the end “For me, becoming isn’t about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim.  I see it instead as forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to reach continuously toward a better self.  The journey doesn’t end.”  This is one of the most remarkable, yet completely ordinary, stories I’ve ever read.  And what it did for me is to help me remember to own, as well as write our own stories.

  For me, Becoming adds another meaning to the phrase""the grass is greener on the other side."" NOT! !!  I have the book a five star rating because I believe that it depicts the true scenario of what being the first black president and first black family in the history of the United States of America was like, not only for Mr. Obama, but specifically for Mrs. Obama and their entire family.  The glamor and the glitz is what one generally sees, what the media and society chooses to focus on.  The behind the scenes anxieties and their impact on the family are rarely highlighted.  The honesty with which Mrs Obama highlights the behind-the-scenes tensions that existed was also refreshing to read.  It makes me wonder why any person of color would want to subject themselves to this type of pressure.  Would we be better off trying to affect change in smaller, more measurable ways.  Will the United States of America ever be ready for a person of color who has visions and principles and a sense of oneness for alk.  I wonder sand I wonder.There was nothing about the book that I did not like.  Reading it felt like anticipating the emergence of a butterfly from it cocoon.  It felt good inspiring for someone like me who has also felt that invisible sense in a room is people who should already know who you are and why you are.  The book is a testament to why education is important; it may not make you a millionaire in that monetary sense of the word, but it could make you a billionaire in many other respects. I would recommend this book to everyone but most assuredly to young black women everywhere.  Becoming is a process that one has to be equipped and prepared for; a process, as we can see by Mrs. Obama's examples, that is never completely done.  WOW!!!

I wanted to read this book to get to know the private struggles Barrack and Michelle went through in achieving something no one has.  This book did exactly that for me. Four stars instead of five only because, in my opinion, Michelle went into too much depth in parts of her life such as the charities she was involved in. Saying this, however, I now understand Michelle is an incredible person and how she became an incredible, influential first lady of our country.

  It is a wondrous truth of this book which helps us to see that we each and all are “becoming “ every moment of our lives.It is also wondrous to have been given such entry into another person’s life; few would allow that let alone one so much in the public eye.This is a story to be read and understood and taken in by men as well as women/girls/children.  It’s a life of learning who one is, the importance of one’s Being, acceptance of Self, and the courage to Be.Would that we each have that “knowing” that allows us to embrace one another as worthy of love and acceptance just as we are, to recognize the innate goodness within us from birth.  Should we accept that truth of Self in each of us, this can truly be a world of Becoming.

  I always knew I like Michelle Obama, now that I have read this book, I like her even more. What a strong, intelligent woman and a wonderful role model. Her journey has really been remarkable. For a woman that has never liked politics, she certainly made the most of her tenure as First Lady; she is a hard act to follow! I loved reading her honest insights about life in the White House, campaigning and raising her daughters in that environment, not to mention her love of her husband and the incredibly strong bond between the two of them.

  The book was ok.For the positive, it was interesting to get reminded of the important carreer Michelle had before becoming the 1st Lady, it was very impressive.. The chapters about how she met Barack and later relating the start of their married life was fun to read as well as the beginning of their stay at the White House. In some parts I couldn't put the boo down and wanted to know more. I did learned a few things.Negative:A lot of it was as well very boring. Especially as she talked about her youth, even though I understand it was essential to know where she was coming from but, gosh... It was tedious !Regarding the way the book was written... Well if you are looking for great literature, this book isn't for you. I found it badly written, sometimes even hard to read.Even though I know it's her biography it's very self centered and sometimes feels like a self praise book. I did this, I did that, I am great, me this, me that...Lastly, I found her quite resentful all through the book. I get that living in the White House was hard on some level but come on... You don't spit where you eat. Every job comes with downside but it seemed like hers was only that.Conclusion; watch the documentary on Netflix and save yourself the time.

I am really getting a lot out of her discussions of what it was like to grow up black in one of the poorer neighbors in America and what propelled her to achieve all that she has so far.

  Coming from the midwest & just a little older, I connected with a lot of her childhood memories. There are some insights from the campaigns & white house I've never even thought about. I listened mostly during my commute so was able to do a couple chapters per day. It's well written & well read. She also is gracious in giving credit where credit is due, regardless of party affiliation.

  I loved Becoming. It was honest, unapologetic, humorous, thought-provoking and at times a tear-jerker. Michelle Obama speaks through her writing as though you are good friends chatting in the kitchen over a cup of hot tea. I finished this book in two weeks and might have completed it sooner if didn't have so many obligations. Just as you hate leaving a long overdue visit with a good friend, you will not want to put down this book.

  This was an excellent book. It was personal, inspirational, and yet managed to not fall into that trap of being ""cheesy and overwrought"". Michelle Obama is a treasure, although according to her, she's just a typical girl from the South Side of Chicago. This was a wonderful insight into what it's like being a normal person who gets swept up into the fascinating and often frustrating world of politics because she married a man who ""saw his way of giving back to his commmunity"" by becoming President. But make no mistake, this is HER story and it's one that needed to be told.

  Written with heart, humility and honesty.  I wish everyone could read her book, especially those who are against the Obamas.  The values, openness and kindness she was raised with are a window into a world few of us have experienced... more's the pity.  Lastly, the humor... gentle and endearing.

  I loved this Book. It was a frank and respectful insight into who Michelle Obama is, many social issues connected with her life, the reality of experiencing a political campaign, and living at the White House (while trying to maintain personal and family identity and boundaries). Wow! I have a lot of respect for this woman. I really enjoyed looking up events on the internet that she discussed in the book while I was reading it. I especially enjoyed viewing on YOUTUBE the Rap in the car she talked about. So cool. Being able to watch these things as I read about them from her perspective made me feel like I had an inside seat to history happening. Amazing! So glad she shared this with us. Thank you Mrs. Obama.

I broke out bawling a good three times. Your emotions will run the gamut. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll bask in this galvanizing woman's triumphs and achievements! Michelle Obama's tome was perfected by seeing her, whom I refer to as #TheLastFirstLady, in conversation at the Capital One Arena on her Becoming tour in Washington, DC. The lines flooded out to the streets and traipsed down sidewalks. You will not regret buying or reading this! It was even more impactful hearing Mrs. Obama read HER story in HER actual voice.  It is so very poignant and moving.

  Inspiring, uplifting, most of all, honest. This book changed my heart in ways hard to explain. So many takeaways but the simplest, most basic one will perhaps stay with me longest. It is the profound power of parents. This remarkable woman was shaped and guided by the devotion and fierce advocacy of her parents. She pays that forward in ways large and small. She reminds us that it is the nurturing of children that ultimately changes the world. Thank you for this book.

  Although we think we know the first family, reading Michelle Obama’s memoir,  I learned so much. Michelle Obama obviously set high goals for herself yet meeting Barrack changed her perspective. Achieving was no longer enough, but having a higher purpose took over. It was enlightening to read about life in the White House through the eyes of a person who probably never expected to live there. Her passion for children, their well being, their education is clear. By the time I read the epilogue, I had tears in my eyes. There is much to admire and inspire us.

  I just love Michelle Obama, and her memoir does not disappoint. Her life story is inspiring and interesting, and she writes in a straightforward, honest voice. Getting to hear her side of the story of President Obama's political ascent is refreshing: how she tried to balance work, family and staying true to herself while supporting the husband whose goals and abilities she supports, and protecting her daughters from too much public scrutiny is fascinating. A woman from truly humble roots who never forgets where she came from, and appreciates some of the luck she had that others do not, her story is a must-read for young women making their way in the world.

  There's was a great deal of information in here that if you've paid attention to the Obamas, you already know. That being said, I loved learning about President Obama's rise from Michelle's perspective. She showed that there was a great deal of hard work, sacrifice, and sometimes disappointed through it all. She demonstrated the difficulty in being a career woman who suddenly has to change up her plans and life when her husband reaches one of many pinnacles in his career. She showed us that even though they were POTUS and FLOTUS, they are still human. They had to grow both individually and as a unit to ensure that their family flourished.

Even though the ultimate outcome of that last election resulted in a massive racist, misogynistic backlash, I feel like this telling can help us preserve hope for a future where America relearn to embrace the power of our strength when we celebrate our diversity. Even though the White House took a sharp alt-right turn in 2017, companies that drive our economic engines have learned that our diversity is our strength.

  As fascinating, intelligent, and charming our Late First Lady, “Jackie O” was, Michelle Obama is all of these - and more - as she relates the story of her life - as of now - in this very well-crafted autobiography.  What comes through most clearly is her love - for everyone who has touched her life.  And her embrace of her womanhood.  What was a bit of a turn-off were some repetitive grammatical errors, as demonstrated in the previous sentence beginning with “and”.  Most distracting was the frequent use of “me and (whomever)...”  I could have best enjoyed the book had I not been privileged to have a very strict grammarian for a seventh grade English teacher.  But I loved the enthusiasm Michelle Obama, J. D.  expressed for her life throughout its story, and for her unending hope for an even brighter future.  One truly hopes it finds her and all of her excellent family.  This is a book I’d recommend to all women, especially young women; and to all men who want, or already have, a woman as a life partner, and want to find one who is ‘Becoming’ or whom they can support in becoming all that she can possibly be.

I enjoyed the glimpses into her thinking, her self-talk, her motivations, her family life—as a daughter, a young professional, a woman in love, a wife and mother.This is a book for someone who enjoys historical biographies. However, Michelle Obama is not a Donald Trump fan and lets readers know that.  I found the occasional references to be honest and civil, but  suspect that some Trump fans may be put off by this—which would be unfortunate. This is a very interesting and inspirational autobiography of a modern American woman. I highly recommend it to all, particularly young women.

I found the occasional references to be honest and civil, but  suspect that some Trump fans may be put off by this—which would be unfortunate. This is a very interesting and inspirational autobiography of a modern American woman. I highly recommend it to all, particularly young women.

  All I can say is that Michelle Obama is a very talented writer with a great story to tell about her journey.  Born into very modest, loving family she really defied the odds against her, graduating from Princeton and Harvard Law and then working in a top Chicago law firm, where she was asked to mentor a young man named Barack Obama.  Their growing love for each other is one of the best parts of this book.  It's just such a pleasure to read because Michelle's voice is heard  in her wonderful use of language.  I highly recommend this book.  You'll really enjoy it.

  Giving the horrible state of affairs in our county under the Trump administration, I reached out for uplifting, optimistic books to relieve my depression over what was happening to our democracy.  Michelle's Obama's book helped me gain a more hopeful perspective.  Her story and their story of what was a perfect administration made me not only relive those wonderful days, but encouraged me to not give up on the promise of our country.  It was a good read especially for this moment,

  I loved the early parts especially of this book about Michelle Obama and her growing up years and her remarkable parents.  This book is very different from what I expected and the way she reveals personal information is unique - it honestly feels like by telling her story, she is trying to help others tell theirs and not feel ashamed of their troubles and failures in life.  I loved it.  Very well-written.  I was a fan before the book and I am an even bigger fan now.

  I love how this book is not a political story, it's an American tale. It's an engaging, down-to-earth look inside the world of transforming from regular people and a regular family to the First Family! Most of us will never know what this life is about, but former FLOTUS Michelle Obama gives you a rare look behind the scenes that has you smiling, laughing and feeling as if you are with them while also sharing  their complex family histories and the whirlwind love story that is hers and former POTUS Barack Obama. This is a must read for the young and old alike!

  The Autobiography of Michelle Obama gave me an insight of her life before, during and after living in the White House. I really was pleased on how she showed that her parents did the Leave it to Beaver scenario, which how many women in the 60's,  did the best to make a home for their family. That is to say it was a simpler time where only one car, and one TV was in a household. Therefore how Michelle chose to be an advocate for less fortunate instead of accepting a high paying job gives you an insight how she was raised with family and community values so of course I was not surprised when she chose a job to help the less fortunate instead of the high paying job she was offered and to me says a lot of a person.

  My admiration for Michelle Obama and her exemplary grace as First Lady was increased tenfold by her literate and moving account of her journeys from childhood through middle age adulthood.  Her recollections are inspirational and sincerity abounds.  There is no posturing and  there is humility.Her passionate support of education and fitness  and her dedication to family  and treasured friends is noteworthy and the novel is well worth the time it takes to read it.

  Excellent. I loved reading her and Pres. Obama's story from her point of view. I loved hearing how she grew up, how their romance bloomed, how the decision to run any race came to be and everything it took out of them and their family. I loved hearing about their lives in the White House and what it was like. Michelle is much more relatable than I expected and I couldn't read it fast enough.  It seemed almost devined that they should be in the White House at the point that they were, for the way it all had to come together to happen. It's too bad our country can't use the work they did to move forward. Everything wasn't perfect, but it was forward movement. I miss their class, their humor, their realness and their heart.

  Whether you agree with her politics or not, you have to really admire Mrs. Michelle Obama for such a poignant portrait of your life, family and philosophy on success.  Her journey shows that we all have it within ourselves to become who we inspire to become if we live by certain principles.  One of the things that really affected me emotionally was how she grew up with doubt about herself and how she was impacted of the hateful, racist things people were saying about her after she became First Lady.

  Just finished listening to Michelle Obama’s “Becoming”. 19 hours in one week. It was revealing and human. I learned so much about the White House. At some points I was like “The Obama’s are #relationshipgoals” and then I’d think “How could he/she stay with her/him?!?” Sometimes she was kind of whiny or boring but that set her up as a foil to Barack. Their relationship is pretty interesting.Mostly I’m left with the feeling that we had it so good with such a devoted eloquent wonk at the helm and what we have now is even more deeply appalling.

  I enjoyed this book of her journey into the person she has become. All of the doubts, lessons as well as how different races, religions and ethnic groups are treated anywhere. How people spread hate as well as friendships.  How she had to show how she has to handle all of these things plus try to be an individual that she wants to be as a woman, mother, daughter, sibling, wife and friend. A lot of her early years were a lot like the  lifestyle I lived. Even though I did not have to go through the racial issues she had to.  I am glad I was able to read her book.

I think she is the most perfect wife for Barrack Obama, and she has been a wonderful nurturing mother to her girls.  I am a Republican, but I find the story of the Obamas rise to fame very compelling.  They are very upright and good people, of that there is no question.  I am grateful that they are in our world!!  Highly recommended!

He couldn't accomplish much due to locking horns with Congress and the Senate but at least he was a very good, clean, moral man who NEVER cost the American people a ton of money with investigations and NEVER embarrassed the American people all over the world.

So basically having her read HER story to me.  It was an amazing experience.  Not only was I reading her words, but I got to experience her emotions behind the words. It made that much more impactful.  What did I get out of the book.  The sacrifices, the compromises, the fears, the level of criticism, the danger and what never crossed my mind, the GUILT that comes with being POTUS and FLOTUS.  In order for them to just go out to dinner, the publics life was turned upside down.  Streets block, security everywhere.  Everyday people at the same restaurant being patted down before seated, etc.  The President and First Lady had feelings of unease, and guilt about what came with being who they were. Seeing their little girls faces in vehicles behind thick bullet proof glass as they drive off.  Quite a humbling and selfless memoir.  We are so quick to judge.  We have know idea what it really involves.  Not a clue.  Until you read...

Everyday people at the same restaurant being patted down before seated, etc.  The President and First Lady had feelings of unease, and guilt about what came with being who they were. Seeing their little girls faces in vehicles behind thick bullet proof glass as they drive off.  Quite a humbling and selfless memoir.  We are so quick to judge.  We have know idea what it really involves.  Not a clue.  Until you read...

  This book was one the best, and enjoyable that I have ever read. It was truly from the heart of Michelle Obama. You felt as though you were setting next to her and she describing her life. I did not want to put it down. I have always loved them and believe that they are truly good people who only want the best for the United States.

  The most intimate and inspiring memoir I’ve read. 5 enthusiastic stars! “For me, becoming is an about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain a.m. I see it instead as forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to reach continuously toward a better self. The journey doesn’t end. I became a mother, but I still have a lot to learn from and give to my children. I became a wife, but I continue to adapt to it be humbled by what it means to truly love and make a life with another person... it’s all a process, stops along a path. Becoming requires equal parts patients and rigor. Becoming is never giving up on the idea that there’s more growing to be done.” ~Michelle Obama #IamBecoming

  What a wonderful memoir! I loved learning about Michelle Obama’s childhood, which in many ways mirrored my own, about her meeting and falling in love with Barack Obama, and their triumphant journey to the White House. I listened to the book as an audible book, so it was wonderful hearing about her life in her own voice. She gave us an insiders view of what it was like to be the First Family, the good, the bad and the ugly and what it was like to be such an important, pivotal part of history. Loved the book and would recommend it to anyone.

  This is a beautiful memoir by a beautiful woman. I only wish that we had the position of “First Lady for life” but I’m sure that Michelle Obama would be horrified. This book should be required reading for every student and adult in this country. As we pass through these most turbulent times, with the Covid-19 pandemic and the realisation that we live in a racialised society with so much prejudice and discrimination, Michelle provides us with hope that we can make a difference. I know that she and President Obama will be in our lives for many years to come and that gives me hope for a better world in our future.

  It is mind boggling the number of opportunities Michelle's parents were able to provide her while growing up in one of the most undesirable places in the country.  Everyone knows south Chicago and it's not a place anyone would willingly choose to grow up in.  I think Michelle's disabled father is the true hero in this story; a person who never owned a home or went to college but was able to put his daughter through Princeton as public utility worker.  I admire Michelle for having the courage to follow her heart and give up a lucrative career to do what she loved.  A truly enjoyable read.

  Let's give credit where it's due. Becoming is inspiring because it is about an everyday American who happens to be a black woman.  She didnt receive a handout. She worked hard and valued education like we are taught to do and on top of that, became First Lady of the USA. To the haters I say put your stupid politics and biases aside and ""try"" to be open to ""differences."" You'll be less miserable.

Loved reading about her family history, and her journey through life showing that nothing is handed to you in life- you do have to work for it. Loved that she went for what her passion was/is in life, and so appreciate all that she has done for others with her work. Great mother, great woman!

  I can’t quite yet put into words how much I enjoyed Becoming. Michelle Obama is relatable, smart, gracious, and most importantly herself. I loved finding all the commonalities between us all...from working mom to wife. While I may not be a former First Lady, I am the daughter of a mama from the South Side. I am a mom, a wife, and a public school teacher. I’ve always admired Michelle for her sense of style, purpose, and fun-loving graciousness. For me, she was Jackie O for the 21st century, and  just like Jackie she left a legacy; one that will be remembered for her authentic self, her commitment to improving the needs she saw around her, and being a mom. My friend Aura used joke that she was an “Obama Mama”, but  that title belongs solely to Michelle, AND the team of folks who supported her 8 years in the spotlight. I am better for having read her story. And I am now quipped with a cool quote to work into next years’s narrative essay assignments. Thanks so much for the story, Michelle. I enjoyed it immensely.

You go on a true journey with Michelle, experiencing her thoughts on family, career, falling in love, politics, and discovery of self. Whether you're a fan of the Obamas or not, this is a story so many can relate to. Michelle opens up and speaks about losing her father, discovering her purpose, finding balance between her husband's ambition and her own, her deep connection with family, and the sacrifices she made for all of it. Throughout it all, Michelle holds strong to her values and shares her story in a clear, entertaining and touching manner. This has been a lovely read by a woman worthy of the admiration she receives.

It's everything I wanted - feeling as if we are friends and she shared this with me alone (and a few million others, LOL). I learned more about Mrs. Obama through this book and I feel as if I know her better now. She's led an amazing life, raised a beautiful family, and been the primary support for the leader of the Free World. That's a resume any woman can be proud of, and I'm especially proud that I got to watch a lot of it happen. She's inspired me to continue working on MY next act with her current activities, and I love the influence she had. Bravo, Michelle!

I was riveted by it and couldn't put it down.It was so interesting to read about how she came a relatively poor family from the ghetto area of the Southside of Chicago. Her parents sacrificed so she could pursue educational opportunities, and she was very intelligent. This is a modern Horatio Alger story. This is why we need to spend more tax money on education for all children.I would highly recommend this book for all Americans. We can be very proud of this great human being!

One of the things I thought was particularly funny was that she did not want to go to certain little girlfriends' homes because of the way they treated their dolls!  She was very observant of others early on and made her life choices carefully.  I thought I would read the book in small sections but I could not put it down.  A great sense of humor.  Delightful.

I admire her more, appreciate the intricacies of what our first family lived through, and have an even greater respect for their sacrifices. The Obama's are the best example of what our leading family should look like and they were not without errors. Upright, smart, with the responsibility to take care of the entire country. Plus, I love how Michelle was transparent about the ups and downs of their lives.

I wish every American would take time to read this book.  It is an easy read, very comforting during these Trump days, and certainly has given me hope that the best of America can still prevail.

  I could not stop reading - it felt as if a new friend was revealing herself to me. Obama is so completely honest.She discusses her family's growth mindset, what forces shaped her, how she helped herself and how others helped her.As an adult, she wanted a simple home life where mom and dad come home every day and spend time raising their kids; she never got that. She talks about how hard it is to have a spouse whose #1 priority is something bigger than your family, house, and kids. She admits to sometimes feeling lonely and resentful (but mostly supportive of all the decision she and her family made). She gave up having her husband's time and attention daily so that all Americans could benefit from his mind, ethics, and work.This is a person who pushes herself everyday, in every job she ever had, to work as hard as possible, give it her all, and try to be the best. An excellent role model for all Americans, no matter who you are or what your background is.

  ""Becoming"" is a thorough and interesting account of a woman's life, from the south side of Chicago to a place few make it to: the White House. Michelle Obama's recounting of her life is fascinating, and nostalgic for those of us on the outside looking in during Barack Obama's campaign and presidency. I recommend this title to not only Michelle Obama fans, but history and political wonks interested in the inner workings of the role of a First Lady, and how she juggles family and her own needs in the public, and overly discerning, eye.

In each part of the book, she examines her interactions with others and , and strives to find her place in that world. She explains the challenges each First Family meets and adjusts to when living in the White House. This was an enjoyable read. Her responses to each situation were  genuine in each instance.

  I love Michele snd learned so much about her and her husband. There was so much information and  her style is wonderful. The book did however seem too long and in need of some tightening in the middle especially. After the election things moved better. In the beginning I was absorbing so much , but then wanted it to move faster. It was comforting to know this great woman was insecure and conscious of her ability to grow and change without losing her essence and her soul. Her sense of humor makes her so real and someone you want to follow for her next chapters. I loved the story and her writing but gave it a 4 because it needed trimming.

I find Michelle's book fascinating with some similarities to my life growing up in a small house full of cousins, uncles, aunts and women renters who worked at the bomber plant during WWII.  Merely mentioning that you went to Princeton and Harvard Law School is not boastful ... boasting not required!  I'm still reading ... can hardly put it down.  So far her book is equal to any written by or about Winston Churchill, the four Kennedy brothers, and many more.The Kindle version is excellently done.

  Unlike many autobiographies of public figures, Michelle Obama's account is a compelling read because it is offered in such an intimate, authentic voice. She draws the reader into her confidences - not salacious revelations, but sensitive insights about the small but critical moments of life and the choices that lead us to become the people we are. It's a remarkable story - as Barack Obama would say, a uniquely American one. It draws the curtain back for readers to see aspects of our America many of us never lived, but recognize, and to see it with the honesty and compassion of Michelle Obama's vision.

It’s excellent parental modeling as I too want my kids to learn to make educated decisions themselves.Reading about the constant desire to do well and the obvious respect she has towards her family, peers, and teachers was very inspirational.

  I have always admired Michelle Obama, so it was a pleasure to hear her story from the early years to the present, how she lived various struggles, took hold of opportunities, and also learned how to care for the less fortunate, both at the community level and with specific individuals. My favorite part was hearing about the comings and goings once she was in the White House. The inside view. A person asked me, ""But why the title BECOMING?"" One possible response can be found early in the book--she did not feel good enough, seemed always to fall short. However, by the end, you might surmise that ""becoming"" means she is ready to take hold of the next challenge, always moving forward, and always caring to make a difference. Michelle Obama has heart, compassion, insight, and wisdom, and we were lucky to have her leadership for the years of her husband's presidency. I loved her book and wish her well.

  This is an extremely well-written book that everyone should enjoy and learn from. Michelle Obama is a person to be admired, regardless of one's possible political partisanship. She writes honestly and easily about her life before meeting her future husband, her life with her husband, then their life (her part of it) with the entire country. I highly recommend the book to everyone.

  Michelle Obama is, in her words, an ordinary person who lived an extraordinary 8 years in the White House. But her life is much more: an account of determination, grace and power of achievement both alone and in concert with many others who shared her goals and dreams. This book is a celebration of and a testament to her strength and intelligence and love under pressure. It is hopeful and inspirational and well worth reading twice.

  Not sure what I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  A south (west) side Chicago resident, it felt like home because of so many familiar things presented throughout the book.There was surprises along the way, with revelations sprinkled throughout!  I would recommend it.  It revealed personality, something I wasn't expecting.I actually listened to it.  Later going through the pictures.

  Michelle Obama is a great story teller. The book is an easy read and at the same time very compelling. The book is really about an ""ordinary"" black girl who thanks to her parents and the support around her; has a well rounded upbringing and how as a young lawyer is ambitious and hard working like so many others. In many ways Barack Obama coming into her life makes Michelle go off her well planned path and into the unknown.....and the rest is history.Michelle is forthright about how as a black and as a woman she had to ""work twice as hard to achieve half as much"". What is amazing is Michelle's positive can do attitude to life. Obama is luck to have had a well grounded partner in his life.Definitely a book worth reading.

  I wish I could have read this as a young woman starting out. I think I might have gone a different direction had I been able to benefit from Michelle’s experiences and how she handled herself.  It’s beautifully and intelligently written, easy to read, and compelling throughout. She satisfied my curiosity of what it’s like to live in the White House as the first family. The energy and fortitude required to be in such a public position is not for the feint of heart. I admire her ability to stand up for what she knew was right and get things done in spite of a sometimes critical, unforgiving, and uncooperative public. She’s amazing and has my utmost admiration.

  This was a excellent book into who Michelle and Barack were before the world knew them. It was also a firsthand account of their journey to the White House. You imagine that it wasnt easy for either of them but you get a better sense of why Barack felt he needed to enter the Presidential race. Yet you also understand despite the unsurities Michelle she supported the man she loved.  I would definitely recommend you read this book about struggle, overcoming the obstacles and more importantly what it means to love and supportive of each other.

I cheered to hear her say so strongly and clearly that they way to often get short shrift in our culture. I loved to hear her clear and articulate support of Barack, but I voted for him too.

The overarching theme is one of hope for the future to be better. Her future, as she grew up and evolved, but then a hope for the future of everyone to be better. I also appreciated all the stories of hard work along the way. Clearly, nothing was given to Michelle. She worked hard at everything she did, including things she didn’t necessarily choose, like being First Lady. A thoroughly enjoyable read that left me inspired and hopeful once again in all that can be.

Becoming is written in the  voice of your best friend sitting beside you and talking about her life.The most important gift I received  from reading Becoming is the wonderful story of two regular, good kids who wanted to make a difference in the lives of others.

  Michelle Obama has been my favorite First Lady in my lifetime (I was born when Truman was president).  Her memoir not only informed and uplifted me, but gave my spirit focus and hope.  Her start in Chicago was not poverty, but it certainly wasn't material wealth.  She acknowledges the family and friends who shaped her growing up were the reason for her strength and courage.  In sharing her story, I was truly impressed with her honesty; and her prose is excellent.  This goes on my list of best books of 2018.

  I loved hearing about Michelle's growing up years with her parents and brother Craig. When the narrative gets into politics, the only person who comes up short for Michelle is Donald Trump.  I know that the Obamas ran a very smooth campaign with harmonious relationships, but this degree of positivity stretches credibility. The interesting question this book raises is how much sacrifice is justified. Their daughters were still young and in need of parenting, but the presidency requires such security that normal is hardly possible. I wonder what the girls would say about the way they have grown up--that's the perspective that would be new.

  The aspect I found most interesting in a book that had many such was Obama's level of self awareness:  she is able to turn her sharp intellect on herself and honestly present her foibles as well as her fortes.  She even makes clear when she is being careful about how she presents or discusses certain events and people, primarily from her years as First Lady.

  This book chronicles Michelle Obama's life in a way that is relatable and down to earth.  I found it to be a story of the joys, trials and worries we all carry with us as parents, friends, and partners, maneuvering our way through raising kids AND keeping sane with work, friendships, family life, etc.  The only difference is this particular story is told from the perspective of a much grander scale, given her role as FLOTUS.  I was able to relate to her on all levels, as a kid growing up in a fairly tight neighborhood, with family nearby, and saddled with the angst and concerns that come to us all.  As she matured and became a wife and mother I found that her concerns were not unlike my own on a day to day basis:  keeping our children safe, giving them a good education,  hoping all the while that they will become well adjusted, productive adults.  However, she had the additional burden of keeping them humble in the face of privilege, the much bigger effort involved in remaining committed to their community, and the additional skill it took in pursuing family interests outside the oval office.  These tasks were not easy as she writes about the safety concerns and protective requirements that are part of being the first family.  But I found her anecdotes and stories to be heartfelt and truthful and am happy that she felt confident enough to share them with us.  Two thumbs up!

We are so different and yet in the heart of what is important, values of love, families, friends and community we share so much. Thank you for being so personal. It matters. I wish you and your husband a wonderful future that you design together. May all who read your words hold them close as we vote in 2020 to make words matter once again. To appreciate intelligence. To respect preparation. To live without a scandal once a minute. To care about our children's future, to return to REAL values like truth, justice, equality and liberty for all. Bless you and yours.Shirley A. Blair Keller, Three Rivers, CA

  I have been a huge fan of Barack Obama from the first moment I heard him. I loved his book, "" The Audacity of Hope."" The title alonen defines him. What I didn't know was what an extraordinary woman Michelle is. Loved every moment of this book. I believe history will one day have to admit that Barack was the best president we've ever had and undoubtedly Michelle was the best First Lady.

  I read this book cover to cover over a weekend where I had to take two 6-hour flights. To say it is an easy read is an understatement. The style is so conversational and if your background and culture is similar to Michelle's you can definitely relate on so many levels. She was able to articulate very complex feelings in a way that made me say, 'I couldn't have said it better' or 'that's exactly how I feel'. I gifted four copies to friends and loaned my copy to my mom. Good job M.O.!

  The book reminded me of a time in our nations history when Hope filled the air. Michelle Obama is a hero to so many. After I have finished her biography I more fully understand why. Her story is an amazing one and it gives anyone who has ever been viewed as “other” encouragement to persevere in the face of odds stacked against them. I finished this book in two days. My first experience with Audible. The story was enriched so much by having Michelle Obama and her rich voice tell me about her life. Everyone should read this book.

  Michelle Obama's book is about much more than life in the White House, in fact, that is almost an after thought.  Thee real draw is the life of a family that did the very best they could to exemplify the American Dream - the respect and love Ms Obama shows for her parents, and they for her is a lesson in parenting.  Her relationship with President Obama has the ups and downs of an actual marriage, but with a level of sensibility and respect we could all only wish for.  It is a great read and so worth it.

  I loved this book, and I continue to love Michelle Obama! I learned lots about her, her family, and what it is like to live in the White House. I laughed and I cried while reading this book. I miss the Obamas in the White House and went back to watch many of the speeches and events she tells about. It made me sad and appreciative to read about how she stretched herself to do things a FLOTUS is expected to do but was counter to who she is. I cannot recommend this book enough.

I am white, and I appreciated learning first-hand about her experiences as a black child / young adult / woman in this country. It served to make me want to examine my own assumptions and how much I have taken for granted in my life. I learned so much from this book. It gave me hope for humanity, too.

  I thought the book was well written and delved into Michelle’s childhood and experiences to where she is today.  Her and Obama made history by becoming the first African American family to be elected and live 2 terms in the White House.  Having 2 young daughter also was quite the challenge.  They overcame the predjustices  of many on both sides, black and white etc.  it was tough having security people around all the time and trying to make things as normal as possible.  They did it with grace honesty and love of country.

  I had expected a book that would focus primarily on the political life of Michelle Obama. Instead, I discovered a multi-dimensional human story.  Politics play a role, but primarily for the impact on the author's self view, her family and the social and economic causes to which she applied her considerable intelligence and energy. She is mission driven to make life better for people. Her passion for children's health and veterans employment have been a centering force for her. She also comes across as very human, something that leaps out throughout the pages.The book has an appealing tone of not pulling punches. At the same time she makes her points in a tasteful, emotionally honest manner. I look forward to her ""next chapter.""

She is so human sharing that politics was not her choice, but how she embraced it and accepted her responsibility to be a change maker. I learned a lot about her husband, how they met and how supportive they are of each other. I loved both of them before reading the book and love them even more after reading the book.

It was even better because I could relate to what I had read in the book moment by moment.

  Book arrived on time and in tact.  What a wonderful read we have.  Read through comments and disdain for MO is evident.  The most hilarious of all the comments is when these underachievers try to discredit MO’s self proclaimed “working class” title.  I guess these folks expected MO to work hard and not be promoted.  “Working Class” does entitle one to promotion(s).  These comments must be from those of whom are expecting the industries of the past to return.  Must be dangerously coal mining.

  An honest, poignant memoir of her humble beginnings, her upbringing by her steadfast and focused parents who taught her how to dig in, overcome obstacles, reach for her dreams. It stood her in good stead. The record of her years in the White House is an insight into the behind the scenes. There is nothing really that’s new — the Michelle we saw is the woman she is. She’s strong and brave, a lion-hearted mother and wife. She’s a leader and an inspiration. I enjoyed the record of her and Barack’s early years.

  An honest, poignant memoir of her humble beginnings, her upbringing by her steadfast and focused parents who taught her how to dig in, overcome obstacles, reach for her dreams. It stood her in good stead. The record of her years in the White House is an insight into the behind the scenes. There is nothing really that’s new — the Michelle we saw is the woman she is. She’s strong and brave, a lion-hearted mother and wife. She’s a leader and an inspiration. I enjoyed the record of her and Barack’s early years. Michelle’s openness, leadership, dignity, compassion and clarity show why she’s one of the most admired women in the world.

  I don't normally read much non-fiction, nor do I normally review books because reading likes are so personal and change. That said, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Becoming."" I've always been impressed with Michelle Obama. This book puts into perspective why. I couldn't put a finger on it before but her love of her husband, girls and country shine through. Also, she has made it her lifes work to help people, and mostly girls and women, be there best selves. I was surprised at her self-doubt but impressed how she would overcome it in situations. I also enjoyed her detailing so much of her life as First Lady. A very good read.

  Great insight into her own trajectory in life.  I admire her for her efforts to make life better for others. It is hard to imagine the confining life of a FLOTUS yet having exposure to wonderful as well as harrowing experiences.  It is great that she was able to transcend limitations to promote meaningful system change. And it is sad that she, and we, now have to watch the systematic attempts to destroy all that she and her husband worked so hard to accomplish. I hope this accomplished, smart, and effective lady is able to become even more effective and enjoy her life more peacefully.

  Michelle Obama’s book not only served as a fascinating chronology of her life and that of her family, but more importantly a look into her and her husband’s unwavering belief in grassroots activism to lift all to new heights. Her frank discussions of racism, gun violence, and anti-feminism are notable. Her devotion to children and the education of young girls in all countries is inspiring and necessary.Clearly, Michelle Obama was a product of an incredible family, filled  with  unwavering love and guidance.

  Michelle Obama has such a way with telling her story. It's as if she invited you for tea, and you're sitting across the table from her. I found her life to be entertaining, touching, and everything that a man like President Obama would find to be a perfect match to his outstanding personality. But she holds her own with such love and compassion. Never ever taking for granted the people that loved her, cherished her, and for every single person that she gave back to.

  In “Becoming,” Michelle Robinson Obama shows herself to be an inspiration to young people worldwide for her intelligence, her courage, her determination and her passion for truth.  In our deeply troubled times, she calls to mind words sometimes attributed to an earlier occupant of the East Wing, Eleanor Roosevelt:  “It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.”  This is exactly what  Michelle Obama has done in writing “Becoming.”  The book is a beacon of light and a source of guidance to young people trying to make sense of what is currently happening in our nation and in our world.  The trajectory of young Michelle Robinson’s life is far beyond what many would have predicted for a black girl raised on Chicago’s south side, but by that very fact proves that the seeds of what we can become lie within each and every one of us.  We are not as we may be perceived by those who lack imagination, empathy and faith, but are instead kernels of possibility, waiting on the nurturing touch of others straining toward the same light, the same truth and the same promise of ‘becoming’ that inspired this excellent book.

She has been a positive force in American  History and I am grateful for her part in serving  my country.  Pay no attention to the one star reviews. I seriously doubt they even read  the whole book.  I believe she wrote this book from her heart. There are those that will not use their heart when reading it. That’s their loss.

Thank you, Michelle, for sharing your story! And please forgive my familiarity but you have opened your life to us, the readers, and I feel I could happily be your friend. I admired you from the moment your husband was elected President and you and him and your beautiful and bright girls so graciously adapted to your role as the First Family. I admire you even more now that you have shared all the ups and downs of those intense years leading to the even more intense eight years in the White House. I think wholeheartedly that Barack and you did a great job. I congratulate you for that and wish you and your family all the best! With love and appreciation, Alicia Rotman.

Overshadowed by her brilliant husband, Michelle Obama is in her own right a remarkable overachiever.  As my Mom would say about people who had conquered their challenges, ""She worked at it."".  She is not shy about criticising D. J. Trump but is so gracious about it.  So perplexing that someone could be elected who has not an ounce of grace himself.I digress.  This book is well written but not bookish.  Her warmth and compassion shine through the pages describing her journey.  A must read.

  I'd never really thought of Michelle Obama much, I mean I knew she was the first black First Lady. Reading her book, though, I really learned about her initiatives. I knew the general gist of what happened in terms of Barack Obama being elected for the first and second terms of presidency, but even though the results were expected, to be immersed into the world is a completely different experience. I laughed, and I cried, as if it was all a surprise to me, as if there was an element of suspense. I love books when it makes you consider things you almost always already knew, but never got to feel or empathise with. In this case, she made me consider how the general public was and is always so quick to make snap judgments about everything, without considering the layers of aspects going on in any one person's life. How other people lay in on Barack Obama for missing out on a vote, because their daughter had had a high fever. On closer inspection, most of us would have put our loved ones first, but no one really looks closer when it's easier to blame someone for anything. I loved this book.

Mrs Obama had endured and handled herself with class and dignity. Most of all, she held on tightly to her family based foundation, never wavering from being a conscientious, beautiful, intelligent, driven woman of color who grew to understand “swerving” in life is scary but necessary.  I’m inspired and encouraged to never settle for less.  Thank you for validating - “I’m enough.”

  As parents, and spouses, the Obamas seem almost too good to be true but I do believe!  (I hope we never find out otherwise.)  Michele's story reminds us that the American dream is not dead and that there are people who care deeply about civility and giving back.  I hope that she never, as she has often said, runs for office because I'd hate to see someone of her character be subject to the muck that exemplifies our current political situation.She is an excellent writer and a clear and expressive narrator.

I hope that she never, as she has often said, runs for office because I'd hate to see someone of her character be subject to the muck that exemplifies our current political situation.She is an excellent writer and a clear and expressive narrator.  Brava!

  *Becoming* is a comprehensive, well-spoken memoir of life in progress fully experienced. The heart of our former (mine always!) FLOTUS feels life’s ups and downs every bit as fully as her well-educated mind rationalizes them.Even in recounting the cloudiest moments of her life, and of our nation’s, Mrs. Obama retains a twinkle of encouragement for her reader. Perhaps this tiny glimmer holds significant reason for her book’s wildfire popularity: its ever-expanding readership is savoring a positivity that we sorely need now more than ever.

  For someone like me who is not American this biography was most interesting. I have not experienced racism and all I know about it is what I have read in books. I was compelled to read again ""Dreams of my father"" by Barak Obama as I thought the two stories complemented each other especially in their differences. Michelle Obama is an example of a true African American and what can be achieved in spite of the racism and the fact of being a woman, with hard work, resilience and perseverance while Barak Obama needed first to find his true identity, a much more complex one. But because of this complexity I think he was able as a President to embrace the whole nation and serve it to the best of his ability even if he was unable to achieve all his goals since the Congress was so much against him and often obstructed his decisions just because he was black. These are the stories of a formidable couple which history will not forget.

  Michelle Obama is so real and warm in this book, letting all of us feel into her heart and mind. I will miss reading her writing, and forever miss the style, intelligence and dignity she brought to The White House. She and her husband will always be my favorite leaders. I am a descendant of the Hairston Clan, working my way through reconciliation of having been the largest slave holders in the country. Michelle and Barack gave me tremendous courage, to lift myself out of the shame and celebrate all that is possible, in a world where power is balanced through equality and addressing racism openly. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to dive deep into the real truth of this amazing first family, and come to a clear understanding of the backlash and horror that ensued when they left.

  When I heard Mrs. Obama was going to write a memoir about her life, I knew at once that I was going to read it. I was excited to read the details of how she and President Obama met and fell in love,  what it was like being a busy working mother of two on multiple campaign trails, the intricate details of living in the White House and how the first family executed their 8 years in office with grace and dignity.Politics aside, this family is an inspiration, Mrs. Obama is an inspiration. I cried when she told the story of the only time the President needed her during the work day, and I laughed when she talked about their girls antics on the campaign trail. I was inspired to expand my own home garden after reading about the garden Mrs. Obama had built on the White House lawn, and will strive to make sure my children have healthier options as they grow.Some of the things she wrote about shocked me, like the federal funding for redecorating for each new first family, or all that is actually included in the presidential motorcade. I have a new respect for all past, present and future Presidents and their families - they really do have the hardest job in the world.The worst part about this book was the end; the fact that it had to end. I wish I had known some of this information while the Obama's were in office and I wish they could have more time. I'm grateful for all they did for our country while they were in office and I wish them all the best for the future.

  To start I want to say that I NEVER write reviews for books, or anything really, but this book was so good I could not hold my thoughts to myself. Michelle writes candidly, in a moving way - the book reads almost like a novel it is so well written. She lets readers into the depths of her life before, during and after the White House. She shares truths that will resonate with so many people, both women and men and brings light to the (still) ongoing prejudiced society we live in, without making anyone feel alienated. The book is raw, but positive and will give you hope for the future of America and your own life, even in this current period we are in. Bravo Michelle, BRAVO.

She shares her experiences of education from her elementary years thru her college years, and how she becomes aware of disparities in her world. Her mother's guiding principles and her father's work ethic, even though he lives with a debilitating disability, instill solid morals and confidence to believe that anything is attainable in this world. After she becomes Michelle Obama, she gracefully, although hesitantly boards the political train that takes her to the White House.

  Everything and everyone has other, and sometimes not so secret, agendas; yet Mrs Obama managed to write a wonderfully light recount of her experience, managing to create such a light setting that it's easy to forget she was living in the White House, falling asleep next to the most powerful man on earth.Is everything true? Was her life such a normal, even unassuming, series of events until that election?I honestly don't care. The story is wonderfully written, alternating moments of stress and tension to everyday accidents (the ones with the Queen made me burst into honest laughing), and that's what I liked the most: no matter how powerful and entwined this woman became, she managed to write her story without ever becoming judgemental or biased. And that's what I take with me after finishing her book:  a sense of equilibrium, of higher values, of unbiased good concepts that don't need labels to be relatable.

  I eagerly awaited Michele Obama's autobiography, ""Becoming"", and it did not disappoint. The book was divided into 3 sections; her time growing up in Chicago, college and early years of working and marriage, and the years in the White House. Each section was candidly written in a very interesting style. I recommend this book to everyone who appreciated all the beneficial work she did for our country. Even more, I recommend it to all young people because it gives one an idea of what is possible in life with hard work and determination!

  I binge read this book during the Impeachment trial. Reading the warm, open narrative of Mrs. Obama was a shelter from the lies and ugliness in the larger world. I still have a sense of dread of what is yet to come, but also the notion that the America that was described in this book is more hopeful than hateful, and eventually righteousness will prevail.  I now want to experience it again as an audio book.  If you still carry hope, Becoming will inspire you.

  Love the book but two copies I bought gave random blank pages. What up with that amazon?I’m terms of the book it was fantastic. I loved seeing a story similar to my own in such a well reveared woman. She is quite candid in her revelations in a way that really reflects many of our lived experiences. I find much of the criticism to be related to those truths which is unfortunate given she didn’t have to be so honest. It’s her story it boggles my mind that people would read and autobiography and be offended that it’s revelatory of the authors true feelings. If you want to know more about who she is as a woman then read this book. If you dislike her or feel that she owes it to you to frame her life in a way that’s palatable to you then you should skip it. Being First Lady isn’t easy especially when you’re criticized for literally any little thing. Some of the criticism here is a continuation of that (black folks should never be anything but happy and grateful especially successful ones so goes several of the criticisms here *eye roll*). A kind smart family woman who offered years of service and has no major scandals and folks still want to find fault lol. Anyway this book is everything for those of us who can relate. If you think you will it’s worth a read for sure.

  This is really Michelle Obama's autobiography.  Naturally there is information about the president, but no more than necessary to complete her story.  I was surprised to learn that she has little interest in politics, and agreed to the run for president because she thought he would lose.  She was honest about the difficulty in becoming pregnant, the hard times while he was in the state senate in Springfield while she was in Chicago, and many unfortunate experiences while in the White House, such as the refusal of congress to even consider bills he presented.

  From beginning to end, I found this a compelling book.  I really knew very little about Michelle Obama's life.  Her descriptions of growing up in Chicago, her schooling so informative and moving. She kept herself out of the spotlight as First Lady.  I understand why but felt somehow cheated that I was so unaware of what she accomplished and the agendas she and her staff moved forward.  We are all in a better place due to those initiatives.

  I’ve always been a fan of the Obamas. However, after reading this enlightened story, I’m a bigger fan now! The book was extremely “real”, showcasing the fears and processes the family went through. The dignity and integrity all of they showed, even with the power they held, is what makes them a favorite. I wish we had more families like them overseeing democracy.

I have so much respect for her heart of service, her opening her life story up and sharing it with everyone publicly after being exposed to so much hurt and criticize. It is raw and a neat look at the first family and yet so sad that to be in that place you almost have to be entirely sequestered from life.

  This is the story of a very self-driven woman. Michelle Obama was very fortunate to have the parents and family support. She acknowledges this continually and how it is a driving force in her desire to build that support for others.  In reading this book there are so many incidents reported that I remember but had not heard the full story or known the context from which it was taken.I don't think many realize the burden she felt for her children being raised in the public eye. In spite of all the advantages that were there, she knew the sacrifices that were made. I think she tells her story well and is very positive on most incidents. The very most negative is Donald Trump's constant insistence that Barack is not a citizen. No one can put blame on her when she said if something had happened to her children, she would never have forgiven him.

  Michelle Obama's story would have been interesting as merely the POV of a woman married to a man who became president but this is so much more.  Her struggles to balance family life and work life resonate with any woman who has had to do so as well.  She is candid about her struggles to reconcile the frequently-absent husband from her vision of how marriage should be.  An amazing story by an amazing woman.  And this is coming from someone who really doesn't like autobiographies.

  This book was very easy to read, well written, and provided a fascinating look at what it's like to be a political wife and First Lady of the US.  The book is very candid about Michelle's life, and I was very inspired by learning about her wonderful parents and Michelle's struggles to become the amazing woman she is today.

  I already felt Michelle Obama was a class act, truly grounded and very intelligent.  She was so candid and honest in telling her story, really well written, interesting and I felt connected to so much of what she had to share as a working mom throughout my own career.  That lovely double edged sword we have carry is worth it.  We still have some work to do (women standing up for women) but we are going in the right direction.  Great job!

  I remember laying on the couch in my living room in 2008 waiting on the results for the presidency to come in.  I fell asleep halfway through and woke up to the news that Barack Obama  was elected. The joy and sense of pride I felt as I watched them take the stage that night was indescribable. Not Just because they are African-American, but because of what they stood for. I didn't agree with everything the Obama administration implemented for our country, but overall, I  consider them to be the best administration this country has had. Reading Michelle Obama's journey sparked a new hope that better is possible. Will it be easy? No. But is it possible?  Absolutely.

  This book was an incredible look at the life and journey of former first lady Michelle Obama. I admittedly went into the book with a biased admiration for her, but the vulnerability and sincerity with which she tells this story was heart warming and encouraging. She discusses her early life and how her humble beginnings on the south side of Chicago shaped her character. She discusses her relationship with President Obama and how their life in politics chose them and not the other way around making for an intriguing and somehow relatable story. She talks about life under the constant scrutiny of the American people and having to navigate an already hostile space as a black woman. I certainly recommend this book for anyone questioning their life path, navigating the complications marriage can bring, or anyone curious about life in the white house.

  This book was such a good read! MichelleObama gave her readers an inside view of the life of her not only as the 44th FLOTUS but as well as her life as a wife, mother,  and professional. Her transparency throughout the  book allows readers to feel better connected to her. She expresses her emotions of trying to balance everyday life in addition to life in politics. She wrote the book and gave me things to think about that I hadn't thought of before in a good way. It starts off slow, but picks up and is definitely worth the read!!

We all have situations in our past that we would rather not discuss . Michelle cherry-coats nothing to her credit , and let’s us all share in her inner thoughts, attitudes and vulnerabilities. Her honesty rather shocked me. And boy can she write and express her thoughts in an engaging manner. I learned a lot about relationships, life in the White House, and walking in another’s shoes. This book should be required reading for all ages.

  It was wonderful to read this autobiography.  The Obamas are brilliant.  They have four Ivy League degrees between the two of them with Harvard Law degrees to top it off.  It was so plain to see was how articulate they both are, and how they truly cares about people.  They endured all the nasty attacks on their character, and all the falsehoods generated in that same vein but through it all, they remained classy.I really am not one to read (auto)biographies but I felt compelled to read this one.  I was so fortunate to have chosen to do so.  It was also a great trip down memory lane through the national and international events of President Obama's terms in the Oval Office.

Also how much protection must be given to our President. Looking forward to her writing another book about life after the white house.

  I was already a fan of Michelle and Barack Obama when I picked up this book. The story of how they made it to the White House has made me even a bigger fan.Mrs. Obama grew up on Chicago's southside. Her path was strewn with people who pushed her to do and be her best. She grew up with a sense of duty to others, of needing to give back, and she did in many ways.I don't give 5 stars often. Only to books that I find myself thinking about long after I've reached ""The End"" and gone on to other books. This definitely fits that description.

  I am probably biased given that I think Michelle Obama is amazing anyway but this book is phenomenal. Michelle is a gifted writer and speaker and I would recommend everyone on any end of the spectrum read her book. It is not hyper-partisan although of course you can see her view point through the words but it doesn't over take the book. She makes it about her and her experiences rather than wasting time on detractors or negativity.

  I liked learning about her life, but thought she would be more fair in how she described politics. Yes, republicans fought against a democrat president and did not want him to serve two terms ... just as Democrats fight against republican presidents and don’t want them to serve two terms.

The values displayed by the Obama’s were strong: when they go low, we go high, and the reality that Black American’s have to work harder to achieve. The concept of swerve as described in the book led us to discuss the swerves in our own lives. Michelle is an amazing woman, whose grace and service to others, especially young women, is inspirational.

  Most political memoirs are bad, cliche, and use life experience as a means of getting to a talking point. Fortunately, Michelle Obama's Becoming, much like Barack Obama's Dreams From My Father, avoids these pitfalls. Michelle is a fantastic author who comes across as consistently authentic despite the loaded nature of ""authenticity"" as a concept and the difficulty of embodying it in a position of mass scrutiny. Strip away the entire second and third sections of the book, which detail the development of her relationship with Barack and her experience as First Lady, and you would still have a beautifully rendered portrait of American life in a working-class neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago that would put many memoirists to shame. Ironically, the least interesting part of this book is her description of her tenure as First Lady, which offers little in the way of political opinions and follows the traditional stylings of the ""person whose life has been upended by fame and power"" narrative. Luckily, the majority of the book more than makes up for this. Michelle Obama has a gift for humanizing herself and relating to people in a non-superficial way, one that no doubt propelled the political superstardom that came to a zenith in the ""They go low, we go high"" speech at the 2016 DNC. She makes you believe in fundamental values of civic engagement and kindness without every descending to kitschiness. This trait, shared by the Obamas, doesn't guarantee flawless leadership or decision-making, but it's so, so rare (rarer than we think!) and a precondition for pushing a moral agenda successfully. This book is well constructed, empathetic, and human despite appearing in a genre where humanity is hard to find - I'd recommend it to anyone with any level of interest in politics.

  I found myself connecting to Mrs. Obama in ways I never thought I would. Our upbringings were different and yet I still felt very connected to her resilience and persistence. It was also nice to see history unfold through her eyes and get to see behind the curtain of political campaigns, political families, and the White House. I now want to read President Obama’s books.

  Michelle tells her story in such a way that you can almost understand some of the workings of a First Lady. By telling her story we get glimpses of what life is like when you are living in a bubble.  She gives so much of how they seemed to adjust.  One gets to see that the First Lady does not sit around doing nothing. She is busy handling more on the home front. Thoroughly enjoyed, it is an easy read and worth reading.

  I belong to a book club.  I took this to one meeting in November and several people decided it would be our book of the month for the first of the year (January).  However, I have read my copy already, and I feel so close to the Obama family now.  I have ordered 5 copies for family and friends.  This is a great read.

  It's an okay book.  I guess if you're expecting white house secrets, you'll be greatly disappointed.  First Lady Michelle talks a lot about her childhood upbringing in the beginning.  But it gets a little more interesting when she starts to talk about how she met President Obama.  But I will always support whatever Michelle Obama is selling because she is a woman who has made a difference in this country.

  This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Michelle Obama is an amazing woman. Having grown up on the south side of Chicago, she graduated from Princeton and Harvard and went on to become the first black First Lady of the United States. She is an inspiration for all women. I had not realized how much work she did for children. From planting a garden on the White House lawn to improving the food served in every school she has improved the health of all our children for generations to come.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to read an inspirational book.

  Especially during this election year, I found the book very informative.  What better read than from a former FLOTUS about life as President and First Lady.  Written well.  You learn about her humble life growing up in Chicago, college years, meeting and falling in love with Barack Obama, his beginnings in politics, his Hawaiian home and African family, and, of course their life in the White House. A must read.  It will restore you with the knowledge that there are respectful politicians!!!

Michele is a wonderful writer and a wonderful role model. I heard her speak at the University of Maine and was so very impressed by her passion and sensibilities. Now I’ve read some of how she became the woman she is today and she makes me proud. This book gives me hope. It would be a wonderful addition to every family’s library.

  This book is simply Michelle Obama having a conversation with you in your living room.  She is telling about her life, in her own words.  I could hear her voice as I was reading.She tells about her very humble upbringing, and how her very hard work opened doors for her.  She tells of her meeting Barak Obama and their relationship and his entry into politics.  She tells a  good deal about the White House and the political environment, but not in a political way, rather an observational way.It doesn't matter where you lean, politically.  This is just a good read.

  I went through a time in my life when the only type of book I enjoyed reading was the Memoir. As a writer in many forms over the years, I find reading someone's to always be fascinating and important, no matter what their history.This is one of the finest memoirs that I have read in many years. I say that because of where we stand in this country today.I have people close to me who could not read and respect Michelle Obama's truth. They would spin over the political comments and history she touts. But, I noted that I was 2/3 of the way done with this book when I read the first anti-Republican remark that jumped out at me.But, by  that point, I had read so much of Michelle's voice that I connected with, that I felt I was learning a new perspective from some a whole lot like myself, despite our vastly different upbringings.She talks often about her hope for our young people and a new country built on tolerance, Grace and respect for differences. But I see a younger generation of kids who are quick to group think and shame. I think it will be up to my generation to continue to teach and reach for a more tolerant and loving tone.I don't know how much help Obama had in writing her memoir. She credits a great many editors at the end. I probably highlighted 10 different places where the words really spoke to me with such Grace. And, a part of me is OK with the thought of a group of all types of folks working together to create something that has the potential to change minds.  I think that is really the point of her writings.

  From “The swerve,” to, “When they go low, we go high,” this book and the writer leave much to ponder and process.  I am glad that Mrs. Obama did not use the pages to settle scores or dish inside scoop.  Her background and accomplishments are laid out and defined for all to appreciate.  Her beautiful words are a salve for the abrasive times we live in now.  Reading the book went by too quickly and left me hungry for what is yet to come.

  Having just finished it, I looked at the Amazon reviews by others and was astonished at many of the negative comments.  Percentage-wise, they are few, but still astonishing.  Clearly most of them come from people who would never approve of Michelle Obama or the wonderful job she did as First Lady.  Much of this is may be attributable to their negative feelings about her husband, a President that continues to stand out for his leadership, dedication and civility throughout his two terms.Michelle Obama was a star, and she made us proud every day for eight years.  Her early life was inspirational, and her years in the White House continue to make me proud.I would give anything to have Barak and Michelle Obama (and their girls) back in the White House today.  I can only hope that their successor is gone before he completely ruins our country and the world!

  This book is amazing.  Michelle Obama did a wonderful job of telling her life story.  I did not know her background or where she was from.  She is such a warm authentic person.  I highly recommend her book.  You will learn a lot about her and her family.  You will also learn a lot about what it is like to live in the White House as a member of the presidential family.  I love that her mother stayed with them the entire 8 years to support them.  I respected her and her husband before reading this book, and now I respect them even more.

  With most biographies of famouse people I tend to get bored with a long and drawn out childhood story but, the way in which Michelle wrote her book, as well as her complex story truly, drew me in. So many times the Black childhood experience is portrayed as negative or almost as unattainably perfect. Her story sounds like my story. SImple, with progressive parents who weren't lackadaisical in their parenting, who taught values and hard work but not so overly strict. Her choices in career and career changes spoke to me of how restless we can be. Her strength and independence shined through her words even as she says she felt treated as a missus.She gave us such a clear view of what happened during those inspiring times and it instantly made memories flood back in of hope, real hope. She layed out her struggles in both fertility and marriage, how she dealt with such extreme critics and even her stumbles on and off the trail. I simply adore this book.

  Michelle Obama is a truly gifted writer. I wish that this book could be required reading for all high school students. If we put our political affiliations and color barriers aside, you will understand that this is a beautiful story of evolving, showing kindness, and leading by example. There are very few books that I read that I do not want to end. It was my privilege to have read such a poignant memoir.

  I love this book. It reads much more like a novel than a memoir. It's into in a way that I never expected. She's brutally honest and warmly heartbreaking. To say I miss the Obama's is a political choice of mine. But, to say that I miss the respect, the dignity that both she and President Obama, should at this point be glaringly apparent! She is ACCOMPLISHED!

  Through this inspiring memoir that starts slow and then picks up pace, Michelle Obama takes us through her remarkable journey to becoming the trailblazer that she is. She opens doors of imagination in the readers’ minds about what they could become by appealing to their optimism, belief in the American dream, passion in their goals, hardwork, trust in society and more than anything else, their compassion and empathy to people from all races and backgrounds. In a day and age that is ever more polarized, and where the differences between red and blue, white and black, left and right are hard to shake, this book is ever-more relevant to remind us that it is all different shades that make a rainbow!

  As a military wife, I was disappointed with the false information presented in this book about how long Obama was pro military. During his presidency he chose to take away bonuses given to military service men and women $10,000. Michelle talks about how she would visit soldiers in the hospital. I’m sure her heart was in the right place, but actions speak louder than words. When my husband was stationed in Kuwait, he experienced severe military cuts. His job was to repair Chinooks. The military was so low on supplies due to president Obama's military cuts that out of the entire flight of helicopters only one was in working condition.

I have no interest in politics and found Mrs Obama’s book to be an enjoyable read really because it does not focus on politics but rather the need for all humans to work together in order to better our world.

  This book lifted my heart and reminded me that only three years ago our government was led by people whose hearts were filled with love, compassion and a desire for our Democracy to offer the best it has to all it’s citizens, red and blue.  There is only a whisper of acknowledgement of the negative pressure Barak experienced from the Republican Congress. Instead it focuses on the accomplishments of both their lives, before and during his Presidency.  It is the story of her life but is really inseparable from his. The story shows a path to success for people who are denied privilege. I loved it.

  Michelle Obama is a terrific writer. Her memoir is engaging, enthralling, informative and important. At times she educates, amuses, saddens and uplifts the reader. There were times that I LOLd and at other times I had tears in my eyes. Truth be told, I'm a long-time Michelle admirer (Barack, too) and this book only increased my admiration. But, as much as I would love to meet her and her husband, the person in the book whom I would most like to spend time with is her mother Marian Robinson. She paints a glowing and lovely portrait of the family matriarch, a woman who come across as smart, wise, kind, patient and endowed with something we could all use a lot more of - good old common sense. This book is high on my list of best works of non-fiction of all time.

An anomaly I thought, until I reached pages 60-61. Then I thumbed ahead and discovered 84-85 and 92-93 are also blank. I think that’s all but it’s enough that now I plan to exchange the book. I’m hoping Amazon will do it although it’s been more than 30 days. If not, then a book store should be able to exchange it. I’m very disappointed. It’s a fantastic read!

  This was a captivating book, detailing growing up on the South Side of Chicago to a very poor family that hung together through thick and thin.  Amazing that Michelle grew up in that environment, with loving and caring parents, and emerged such a powerful figure.  She added so much to humanity and is to be congratulated for it!  Her years as the First Lady were incredible and she raised two young girls all the while.  I wasn't aware of the demands made on a first lady and this really opened my eyes.

  I loved everything about this book. Michelle Obama not only gives us a glimpse into her childhood upbringing, personal life with Barack and what it was like for her during the First Lady years, but there is also a very thoughtful and thought provoking thread throughout the book about the black experience in Chicago and the nation in general. I didn't want to put this very readable book down and look forward to one day reading more from this very remarkable and down to earth woman whom I believe is a national treasure.

  Heavy on the self-hagiography.  The earlier chapters about family members and their hardships in Chicago were illuminating and real. Mostly though,this becomes a book about a woman determinedly unaware of the privileges that broke her way, and unable to lay blame for anything, even her few blunders, on anything but race.  This subterranean animus and the Michelle is always right theme became  tiresome and predictable.  Loved her mother and especially her father.

  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It was so well written, I could almost hear Michelle's voice saying the words as I read them. It felt very intimate, as if we were best friends and she was telling me her story.It also made me realize how very much I miss her and her amazing husband. (there was a lot of sighing and crying on my part because of this)  I am more of a fiction reader, mainly because reality sucks, but I was so captivated by her story it was a very easy read.  Thank you for sharing your story.

  Honest, forthright autobiography of an inspiring, self made woman. Raised in a modest neighborhood, with a focus on education and support of family, Michelle took advantage of all avenues of the schools she attended. Rooted with the support of her mother, always making sure her daughter’s classroom met her scholastic challenges and a disabled, hardworking father, Michelle Robinson Obama continues to “give back” to her community as well as our nation.Well written and heartwarming story of a great woman.

  Unlike many celebrity memoirs, Michelle Obama's book is well-written with lively prose and an authentic voice. I did not expect a ""tell-all"" and would have been disappointed to find one. What I discovered is an author who convinced me that her story was true to her nature from the very first page. I greatly admired both of the Obamas before I began reading this informative book, and admired them even more at its conclusion. If I had to select a favorite aspect of this lovely memoir it would be Mrs. Obama's honest and loving rendition of her mother, who continues to play a key role in her the Obamas' lives.

  I've admired and adored Michelle Obama for a long time, and after reading this book, I admire and adore her even more. We are roughly the same age so I wish I had known her when we were kids... but, I was a white kid in the south, and she was a black kid in Chicago, so I guess the chances we'd ever meet were about zero. Still, some of the similarities between her upbringing and mine surprised me and made me smile (and before anyone comments on that, the surprise is because she was in such an urban area, and I was on a farm.)

Michelle is not afraid to share her journey as an American; what it means to be a part of a country that is still struggling to define itself.  Are we a country of immigrants or are we  a nation only for those who are white?  This is a key question for everyone to answer and reconcile with.  America is a multicultural and multi-ethnic nation and we we should embrace it as our strength.  Just as a person is constantly changing as he/she comes into contact and interact with others, a nation must seek its identify and embrace the changes that it goes through to become something better.  The sum of all the parts is greater than any individual.  This is the message of the book and it is told in a graceful and entertaining read.  I recommend this book for those who seek to learn more about himself or herself and seek to understand more about the journey that our country is going through.  We are all on a quest to becoming.

  I've always loved Michelle Obama.  This was so worth the purchase, I bought Digital copy and a hard copy to add to my collection.  Our first lady is the epitome of grace and elegance. I felt this read was genuine, honest, loving and touched me in many different ways.  I won't give away too much because there is so much I loved about this read.  I loved, loved, loved when she spoke of her husband the 44th and how they first met.  A must have for any book collector.

  I am constantly amazed how one person can ascend the ladder in America.  I grew up sandwiched between the south side of Chicago and Gary, IN. I have seen both sides of the coin - underserved and privileged. The trappings, limitations, struggle, triumphs of both. Ms. Obama eloquently describes the divide. Society is shaped by strong women such as these, we should learn from them in the hope of shaping a brighter tomorrow.

Spoiler alert: have Kleenex handy for Chapter 11.Mrs. Obama: if you ever read reviews, I want to say THANK YOU for everything you've done even before entering the White House. You are the perfect role model for all children (boys as well as girls) and you brought class and dignity back to the White House.

It is every bit as inspiring as she has been. There are moments when I laughed aloud and other moments where I was brought to tears. I hold this woman in an even higher regard and I am glad my daughter gets to witness such a public person. She is very relatable beyond her blackness. I would highly recommend.

  To say I had a hard time putting this book down, would be an understatement. I wanted nothing more than to take an entire day to dive into each and every page, soaking up all that I could about our former first lady. At a time when grace and dignity are clearly lacking in the white house, I found myself longing for what was and hopeful for what could be again. Michelle Obama illustrates her struggles as a black woman from a neighborhood that was turning toward despair. I can never begin to understand what it feels like to be a woman of color, nor will I pretend too. But I do know what it feels like to be a woman in a world where people tell you you're not good enough, and make you feel ""other"".No matter what your views on this beautiful human being is, crack open this book and take the world from her point of view. It's beautifully written and eye opening.

I admired her desire to be more than just the wife of the President of the United States with her efforts to help children make healthy choices with her White House vegetable garden, her efforts to get children to be physically active, and her efforts to be involved rather than just lending her name.

  Michelle Obama's autobiography is not only about becoming for black urban women, but touches every woman not born into a life of privilege. Many of the issues she raises about earning her place, I similarly experienced in leaving a rural area of Pennsylvania in 1977 and arriving at the steps of Harvard University, looking forward to a great adventure while being scared and concerned whether I ""was good enough"". When she mentioned the ""Artichoke"" quandary, I laughed out loud remembering my own identical scene. I hope I can remain as hopeful and graceful as she remains after the last election.

  I love non-fiction. Love learning about all kinds of people, and Mrs. Obama was no exception. Her book is thoughtful and insightful. I grew up in a predominantly white middle class town, with very little exposure to people of color. However, I also lived in West Africa as an adult for 4 years where I was the minority. While I didn’t agree with all of Mrs. Obama’s political views, I firmly believe she is like most mothers...she simply wants a better world for her children, and ultimately her grandchildren. I learned a little about what it was like to grow up on the southside of Chicago, live in the White House, and everything that came with both of those experiences (what? You paid for your own food??). But I also learned that regardless of the color of our skin, she and I grew up in a similar home; one with loving, but strict, parents. One where education was important. Highly recommend this book, regardless of your political views

  From the opening sentence, I felt as though the author was sitting across the table from me. Her voice is so authentic and sincere from beginning until end. She tells her life as it has been and does not sugar coat anything. She makes it clear from early on that politics is not her ""thing"". Her sincerity, warmth, intelligence and fortitude should be an inspiration to both men and women of any political persuasion. It is truly an excellent read!!

  I purposely read this book slowly, because I wanted to savor each word. Michelle Obama did what good writers do..she made me feel and experience her FLOTUS life through her words..... its ups, downs, triumphs and tragedies. And, since our　political　landscape　has　changed　so　drastically since the Obamas left office, my most fervent hope is that she would change her mind and RUN FOR PRESIDENT !!

She made me feel the struggles, laugh at situations and grieve at some of the experiences she shared.  I am so glad I own this book and have recommended it to many.  Though, I have to confess, while engrossed in this book, I found myself in despair over what our country has become. She exudes such hope and now there seems to be none.

Annoyed, that so much of the beautiful work, the steps forward, are being systamtically errased by a floundering fool, a jester of no class. Enpowered, that all the world is still malable. Humbled, that I now believe we are all here for a purpose. Determined to make and become my best! God bless the Obamas ! Thank you!

  I was loving the book, ""Becoming,""  until I got to the middle where there are 16 pages that are blank.  The empty pages randomly occur between page 178 and 207 and were there but with no printing.  The following printed pages were numerically meant to include those empty pages but with printed content. I am convinced that this book was acquired from an unscrupulous underground source.  The publisher wouldn't sell it this way.

  I recommend the audio book! Michelle herself narrates it, and it's cheaper than the Kindle or physical versions. Her writing style is pleasant and her observations are inspiring. She doesn't brag or pat herself on the back. She actually makes a point to say that she is successful because of the opportunities given to her, and never points out that she is better than anyone ever in this book. There is plenty of content about her husband, and will show how grassroots both of them are. It was never boring, even to my friends that don't like reading.

Having experienced a small amount of racial indifference growing; part Native American and female. I lived with knowing my father didn't really accept me, because I was suppose to be a boy.  My future was to grow up a be a wife and mother, no expectations of college. Reading about Michelle Obama, I find myself ending her in a lot of ways.  I truly hope she reconsidered a run for president, I know it's a lot to ask; I think she would be great.

  I am so very disappointed.  I bought this book in November, however it was added to my ""need to read"" pile and I just started reading this book about a week and a half ago.  When I came upon Chapter 13, I found that several pages were ""white-washed"", so light they could not be read, or completely white.  Then, there were normal pages of text that were just fine.  This continues on throughout the entire chapter of both chapter 13 and 14.  I am completely disappointed as Amazon said there is nothing I can do about it now.  I did not get to ""talk"" to an actual representative.  In my opinion, this book should be replaced.  It was sold to me as ""new"".  As you can see from the pictures.  It is a defective copy.  The book itself has been excellent so far.  The content is wonderful.  I am so sad.

It is honest, inspiring, dedicated to anyone who thinks they don’t count or couldn’t accomplish what others have done. Thank you to Michelle Obama for taking the time to write. It also made me sad at the current state of politics as delivered on the news and social media. I look forward to the next election in hopes of having a family of integrity again who also have a sense of humor.

  I'm not usually a big fan of autobiographies but I wanted to give this book a try. Michelle Obama's writing in this book is clear and sincere, without any frills or airs. From her Chicago Southside upbringing, to her studies in Ivy league universities, and through her various careers and her terms as the FLOTUS, she manages to tell her story in a relatable, funny, yet down-to-earth way that makes her so endearing to me. She is trying (and succeeding) to both define and be true to herself as she grows through the different stages of her life. I read about her struggles, and how hard she had to work behind the scenes in order to appear so effortless and flawless on TV. She truly is an inspiration. 5/5 stars for this amazing book.

From her Chicago Southside upbringing, to her studies in Ivy league universities, and through her various careers and her terms as the FLOTUS, she manages to tell her story in a relatable, funny, yet down-to-earth way that makes her so endearing to me. She is trying (and succeeding) to both define and be true to herself as she grows through the different stages of her life. I read about her struggles, and how hard she had to work behind the scenes in order to appear so effortless and flawless on TV. She truly is an inspiration. 5/5 stars for this amazing book.

  I did not know that much about Michelle Obama.  I heard her speeches on Youtube during different conventions, and she has always been articulate and graceful.  She seemed to ooze confidence and charm.  I took her book on a cruise and could not put it down. I read straight through it.  She impressed me with her calm under pressure; through all the criticism, she saw how she could improve instead of attacking.  She asked the same questions that we women have been asking for centuries. Am I good enough?  Through all her accomplishments, she is still striving.  I love her spirit and integrity; She serves as a role model for all women and girls.

  I just finished this last night. It makes me miss the Obamas even more. It was great to learn of Michelle's working-class upbringing on the South Side of Chicago. She had loving, supportive parents who worked hard to give her and her brother a good start in life by making sure they had educational opportunities. She and her brother worked hard and fulfilled their parents' hopes for them. I enjoyed the personal look into her relationship with Barack, her children, and her extended family. I highly recommend this book.

  Ha! 2 years out of office and we’re still living on not 1 Obama, but 2! Her story is Every Colored Woman’s story in many ways. I’m so grateful she literally opened up and shared her life then and now. This is a must read and share. She can throw some shade! Don’t let being the 1st lady fool ya. I can now understand why she’s so strong. I admire her on many levels.

  Understanding where and how Michelle Robinson Obama was raised lets the reader understand her upward travel in life.  How she survived campaigning and the confinements of the White House. How she could raise two remarkable daughters and be a loving wife under the constant scrutiny of the public.  Michelle's ability to  write candidly and from the heart make this a must read.

  Inspiring, honest, full of hope.  This is more than an autobiography.  This is a book of inspiration, hope, humor, and encouragement to continue becoming your best version of yourself no matter who you are.  I miss Michelle Obama as our First Lady - but I am so glad we had her for eight years.  She's a beautiful example of how to be a woman, a mother, a leader, and a spouse.

Dont get me wrong, I loooove Mrs. Michelle Obama, she is fierce, equipped with  beauty and brains, but I found a lot of this book to be dry (especially in the early chapters); however, it got better as she addressed her experiences in office with Barak, they're dating life, and evolving family life together.

  I had really high expectations of this book because everyone was talking about it.

I would suggest that if you buy this book, don't buy it from Amazon or else look to make sure all the pages are there.

My mother raised 8 children and was my best friend and my hero.  My father worked in the coal mine and was not such a great man.  My Mom kept us all together.  My dad was abusive and frightening at times.  We were poor and we were bullied and discriminated  against because  we didn't have the best clothes or the nicest homes.  I kept my grades up in school and worked my way up to now that I own my own business.  This book drew a wonderful comparison between myself and Michelle even though we lived in a different period of time.

  Michelle Obama is an inspiration, especially given her background growing up on the south side of Chicago.  She had a wonderfully supportive family and being super smart and open minded didn't hurt!  My favorite part of this book was reading about her early life in Chicago through her initial meetings with Barack Obama.  Much of the rest of the story, we know, although there were some interesting tidbits which made reading through to the end worthwhile.

  ""Becoming"" is a very well written autobiography.  Michelle Obama describes growing up on the Southside of Chicago during a time of continued struggle for inner city kids.  Her parents were staunch believers in education, continued learning, and respect.  This background also caused her issues because she ""talked like a white girl"".  Through continued education, perseverance and continuously pushing herself, she became a lawyer.  Her beliefs in family, nutrition, and education were maintained in all that she did.  Great read!

I was so impressed by her determination even as a preschooler to excel, in piano, later in school, and in her assent in her career. She was so perceptive in recognizing nuisances of how people reacted to her, being a woman of color, and in how she would not allow people to “put her in her place.”  She and former president, Barack Obama, are truly classy, and I appreciate their efforts to find good in others and help those less fortunate rise.

  It's refreshing to read a memoir where the author doesn't try to present a constructed persona of themself...or does so in a way that doesn't sand down all the rough edges that make a person interesting--and human. MRO reveals herself to be driven, ambitious, and at times critical. This is (unsurprisingly) a well written book: my only critique is that narrative becomes (perhaps out of necessity) less detailed in the White House years. Michelle Obama is no politician. A shame, really.

  Becoming by Michelle Obama is a reminder that anyone can get the job done. She was vulnerable in each chapter, yet reminded us that she is a career woman, a wife, a mother, and above all a human being just like each and every one of us; every time a new challenge rose, she threw herself in without losing her voice. My favorite part of the book is when she strived to promote girls' education/ education for minorities in general. Thank you for reminding us that, if we just believe in ourselves, we all deserve a seat at the Ivy League schools! Honestly this is one of the best investments of 2018-19, and definitely worth every penny.

  BECOMING is well written and contains many stories about Michelle Obama's life. She sees the notion of BECOMING as ""growing up with intention."" Her mom taught her how to speak, think critically, and draw conclusions about subject with her peer groups. It has shown me that children need to be taught about emotional intelligence, recognizing inferences and using their imaginations when reading, writing, and problem solving Pre-K-4th grades.

  I have enjoyed every moment of this journey. It was a lesson to young women, a support to family love and boundaries , and insight into what human spirit can accomplish! The Obamas have changed how integrity is viewed and showed America what resilience and class can look like. I admired this family from the beginning, now I'm in love. Thank you

  I enjoyed this book very much.  The first part (pre-White House years) was the most interesting to me.  Her life when she was growing up in the South Side of Chicago.  Her relationships with her family members and friends.  Her experience at Princeton University.  Her choices in careers.  And her meeting Barack and some of the aspects of their different personalities, backgrounds and approach to life.  The White House years were interesting, but not nearly as interesting to me as the first half.  Still, I recommend it.  If for those who were not fans of the Obama administration.

  I liked the stories of the Obama Family.  How Michelle and Barak met and fell in Love.  What it meant for both of them being the first African American couple in the White House.  The highs and lows of what that meant for their family.  Also how  many of these things are familiar to families everywhere, but often more poignant for any family living  such a public and  scrutinized life.  She makes us see that all of us affect our times and circumstances in our own small sphere of influence in which each of us lives.

  It is a real accounting of the struggles to become on the partner track at just the right law firm. And what happens when you start over. It is meeting the perfect guy who is a little more laid back than you like, but taking a wonderful adventure with him. It is a bail about raising children and going to couples therapy. It is recounting of the ups and downs of being the leader in chief. It is warm. It is funny. I miss the Obama family in the White House.

I thought it would be interesting, I would read about her ""first lady"" role(s), duties, responsibilities, and a lot about the president. I was surprised she shared so much of herself and when folks saw me reading Becoming, they would ask me if it was good. I always answered, yes, you will love it and you will feel proud she was our first lady. Becoming was warm, sincere, and intentional. It makes you think of your story, your Becoming.

  This book illustrates the four concentric circles that make up Michelle Obama's life and the source of her strength: Family, Community, Nation, the World. Firmly rooted in the first circle, her life expands into the outer circles until her emerges as a world figure. Fittingly, only the last quarter of the book deals with her White House years, so you have a profound view, written with deceptive simplicity, of remarkable individual growth and transformation.

  Michelle Obama's experience of growing up in a poor but loving family and an unprivileged circumstance resonates a lot with many American families, including mine. Her resilience and determination to make the most of all the opportunities given to her as well as to strive to improve the financial situation for her family and her future children is extremely admirable and inspirational. I can relate to a lot of her sentiments, since I also encountered many of her challenges growing up. Just like her, I was determined to go to college and subsequently finished a doctorate program that eventually landed me a job that affords me financial stability and happiness. I hope her efforts at helping inspire and support underprivileged kids to discover their hidden potentials and to overcome adverse circumstances will live on and we will see many successful and accomplished young adults in the next 5-10 years.

  Loved it from the beginning.  Enjoyed how Mrs. Obama described her humble beginnings, her humanity, herself.  It was interesting and I enjoyed the information given while being the First Lady.  We rarely get to know the inside of the White House from the everyday living point of view regarding the body guards, the garden, the staff assisting them. That was cool to read.  Throughout the book we are entertained by this beautiful, real woman who showed us her humanitarian side, her feelings and emotions.  Could not put it down.  An autobiography that I fully enjoyed reading.

  Honest,well written account of growing up as a first generation upwardly mobile minority person in the 60’s and 70’s. We were the product of hardworking, optimistic, positive parents and mentors who enabled us to overcome societies odds against us. Like Michelle, most of us now seek to make it easier for new generations even when they aren’t blessed with extraordinary parental support.

  Portrait of an accomplished woman who can hold it down, a calculated risk taker, and a seeker for the common good. A book that also make you laugh and yes shed a tear or two. Have a glass of wine or cup of coffee and take a deep dive in a good read as the first lady (this role remains empty at the Whitehouse!) shares her hard-earned wisdom!

  I liked the book but I was a little disappointed. She left out important parts of her life that I would have liked to know about. For instance her High School trip to Paris and she did not talk about her years at Harvard law school. Not one mention. I found that very odd. I'm a big fan of her and Barack, overall I did like the book, it was just not a 5 for me.

  This is a terrific book about an amazing woman.  She is truly an American.  She loves her Country, her Family and her Friends.  Raising people’s knowledge about things that really matter in the World around us and encouraging the help of people who have a lot of pull in getting things done is what this woman did to make the World a much better place.  Her love for children both hers and all girls has helped a lot of girls’ dreams come true.  A great read.

It's simply astounding what First families go through to get adjusted to their future in the White House.

  I liked the no nonsense telling of a life’s story, one worth hearing. Easy to understand and sometimes difficult and convicting to take in. For anyone willing to hear a compelling perspective of the times we live in. Especially for those looking for the courage to form the parts of their life into an equally important and compelling narrative, free of the crippling critical voice inside our heads.

  It’s hard to overstate how good this book was. Michelle’s writing is superb:  multilayered, detailed, funny, heartbreaking, vulnerable, intimate.  If I ever have the good fortune of being able to speak to this wonderful woman in person I would thank her for her hard work and apologize for the oftentimes awful conduct of many of my countrymen. You and your family deserved much better and at the time this American had no idea how lucky he was to have you folks.

  To start from such humble beginnings and to rise to one of the highest positions in the land, is a remarkable achievement.  Her family's love, support, and sacrifices, helped to make her who she is today.  Her drive and ambition enabled her to be successful long before she entered the White House with her Husband Barack Obama.  What a life!

  What I loved most about this book was that it wasn't the story of the president's wife or of the administration's work from her point of view. This was about a woman and what made her special, and what precisely did not. There was enough humble-brag to make it real. And enough emotion to give depth without playing the world's tiniest violin. Importantly, it answered my questions about what happened to the woman Michelle Robinson Obama. Turns out, she was there all along

  ""God is in the details."" From those first details that never end, I felt I was more than a reader---a friend, a part of the family. I was drawn to the quality of determination and its strength in every activity, whether it was keeping family important or getting projects accomplished---inspiring! This book is as much a movie as a book.  I hope you continue writing, Michelle. You are a born writer, and yes writers have teams. Your writing is a flow of conversation that taking the black ink off the paper becomes family or friends in conversation---as if you are living it as you write. With gratitude for your huge effort of writing, and gratitude for all those on your team.

  I liked her childhood and university stories a lot.  I was struck by the difficulty she and other African-Americans have in accepting themselves as capable people; the constant self-questioning.  But I thought the times in the White House were sort of mundane and I found myself wishing she had given much more personal accounts of the people she encountered during that time.  It was a rather cautious approach.

Michelle Obama is a beautiful writer and a beautiful person.  She is the perfect antidote to the bullying and the wealthy entitlement that inhabits the White House now and is truly a great example of what meritocracy means, again in such a contrast to the inherited wealth and the immigrant wife who inhabit the White House (despite, incredulously,  losing the vote count in the 2016 presidential election by 3 million votes).

  A reflective and revealing view into the life of First Lady Michele Obama, from girlhood through her White House years. Clearly written with humor as well as gravitas, we get to see the kind of person Mrs. Obama is, and also some glimpses into the family in which she was raised, and the people who mentored and supported her along her journey. Especially enjoyable was her professional journey from law practice to public service and anecdotes around family life with the president and her lovely daughters.  Mrs. Obama isn't shy about her struggles with motherhood in the White House and how she could honor her professional goals while supporting her husband on his own incredibly demanding journey as well. I wish there were more to read!

I could identify with a lot of what Michelle wrote about, as some of my own childhood experiences were very similar.  Side note:  I am a church musician. I had completed reading the story about her musical recital just a few days before a child at my church needed to be shown middle C to play a piece at a special program one Sunday afternoon.  After pointing it out, I was returning to my seat, and was awestruck by the similarity of that event!  Great read, and wonderful weave on the story line.

Thank you Michelle for speaking to the heart of women everywhere and showing us that regardless of where we are we can create and be who we are while “Becoming!”

  This is an excellent autobiography and memoir about former first lady Michelle Obama. She really gives you a close look into her life. The book is professionally and aesthetically compiled. The documentary BECOMING is a must see film. It goes hand in hand with the book. This book depicts what an intelligent, strong, caring, positive and optimist woman Mrs. Michelle Obama truly is.

  An incredibly down to earth look at what it took to be the first lady of the land and still remain a real person.  The remarkable integrity it takes to hear such awful lies about yourself and the people you loved most in the world and still maintain you dignity.  Michelle Obama is one classy lady. I'm glad I lived in the same time frame.

  Partly a fascinating glimpse into life in the White House, and partly the story of Michelle. The beginning of the book is better than the second half which becomes a kind of anodyne description of Michelle’s projects as first lady. The first half in which the young Michelle is actually “becoming” makes the book worth reading.

An endearing chronicle of Michelle Obama and the emotionally charged life she, along with her family has lead.

What an amazing snapshot of history in the making!

  I loved how candid and forthcoming Michelle is in telling her story. From her childhood growing up in the south side of Chicago to her journey as a mother and partner to a man with a vision of change and hope, her authenticity is so refreshing and inspirational. I have recommended her book to friends and the first question I get is, “is it political”? I don’t think it is. It’s the story of a feisty, courageous, committed and devoted woman who is pulled into a role she didn’t plan for herself but handled it with grace and humility. As we witnessed her as First Lady, and since she’s reentered public life, Michelle is a passionate leader who has and still is making a difference. The book is well written and enjoyable!

  Michelle Obama is a gifted and talented writer with a voice that calms and soothes as she reads her great story. I purchased the hardcover and audiobook. I am so humbled by this beautiful (inside and out), brilliant woman, her audaciously intelligent, humble husband, and a family that worked hard to give the best to their children. Michelle was raised with love, support, and hard work that permeates the framework of who she is before, during, and after the White House.  Knowing her and her family through this book gives me hope that the Obama's, including their daughters, will contintue to contribute to the greatness of this country as they did for 0ver 8 years.

  A wonderful page turner about the highs and lows of Michelle Obama's life.  I found the story of her years growing up in the Southside of Chicago the most interesting.  It is a fascinating success story about a spunky little girl whose competitive drive and encouraging and supportive parents allow her to achieve the remarkable - Princeton and Harvard!In adulthood she comes across as down-to-earth, smart  and very loving, especially with her children.  It is a story of her life rather than the politics whirling around her.  Rising above the bad, unfair and exaggerated press reports she learns how to make the most of each personal encounter.  And, of course, she shares everything with her partner and friend, Barack (or 'Barry' as his childhood friends called him - interesting tidbit).

  Loved this memoir by former First Lady Michelle Obama. It depicted the rigors of politics, the heart wrenching moments of gun violence and the endless responsibilities of being a woman, a wife, and a mother on the National and World stage. I learned and I teared up while absorbing such a remarkable and honest story. I loved the dignity shown by the Obama Family while their every movement or word was heralded or rejected, or critiqued by so many. Becoming is a book I would recommend highly and I feel that all women will find notes of “connection” in the story of a young black girl who always asked herself, “am I good enough?”

You get a glimpse of Barack as an up-and-coming law student in the first 100 pages, so there is plenty about Barack. She went into great detail of the Iowa primaries in 2008 about how that would set the tone for the presidential elections that year.

  This was our small book club's selection for our next meeting.  It was assigned at the beginning of December and by our meeting in February, several members still had not finished reading the book.  We all have active lifestyles, and the holidays did play a part in the length of time it took for us to finish reading the book, but it took longer than all the other books to finish or almost finish reading.  It was a very well written book, with the preciseness of detail that you would expect out of a lawyer.  It was open and honest, especially about her personal feelings and attitude.  I learned a lot about Michelle, her family and her husband and his family that I did not already know.  After reading her book I feel she is a regular person, slowly accepting the fact that she really isn't as regular as most of us.

  I loved how she was able to smoothly segue to each memory of her child, teen and adulthood. I was surprised how effortless the writing was to achieve this.I related so much to her upbringing which was cool because I did not grow up to become a lawyer or First Lady of the US. The life lessons she was told were similar to what a lot of us learn as we grow up and mature.This book was genuinely written very well.

  Michelle takes the reader through three important stages of her Becoming. She first gives us valuable insight in to her education from the south side of Chicago through law school. Then she allows us to see the role and the demands of a presidential campaign on the spouse and family of the candidate. Lastly, she shares with the reader the demands of a First Lady who is also focused on being a good mother, a loving spouse, and a role model for women and especially girls.

  I appreciate the explanation of her background, growing up in a loving family, valuing their input without stifling growth. Creating a picture of what must have seemed like single parenting a few times, yet remaining true to the family unit. Most of all speaking the truth, without spin, of the highs and lows of being a part of the nation’s first family.

  M. Obama's book was worth every minute that I spent reading it.  I laughed; I cried; I even took some notes.  (Everyone has a story and everyone's story is worth telling...but I don't think they're all worth reading!)  M. Obama's story is not only  inspiring, but helps us walk a mile in her shoes.  She shares her life as a daughter, a wife, a mother, a volunteer, a caring citizen and as our First Lady.  I loved her book and highly recommend it.

Her imagery is very vivid, taking you back to her South Side upbringing, her internal personal struggles and journey through life. Being a working mom with a husband also simultaneously trying to make a lasting impression on this earth. She lays all out there, all the questions we ask ouselves, the burning curiosity about the presidency.

A book I would warmly recommend.

  A black girl from South Side of Chicago becomes a First Lady, that in itself is extraordinary. Although Michelle Obama considers herself an ordinary woman, she is more humble, caring, determined, and patriotic than most of us. The book opens our eyes to life of a working class black family that a few would consider as All American in their ignorance and prejudice if they had not read this book. There is much we need to learn about black life in America than what the evening news portrays. A must read for all Americans.

  I loved the Obamas and especially now, with who our current president is.  This book was very well written and I couldn’t wait to read it each night.  I actually felt like I had visited the White House.  Thank you, Michelle, for all that you did as First Lady.  You inspired the country to go high...Even when it is hard...your whole family made the country proud.

  I was so looking forward to reading this book by Michele Obama.  And it didn't disappoint.  I was interesting to read her side of things, because you read about certain things in the media, but Mrs Obama is very candid.  I know It would be very hard on children to adjust to White House living, but in reading her book, the first lady seems like she had handled it very well. It appears the girls are well grounded. Good book. I recommend it to anyoney.

  What an amazing journey and what testimony to family values. I appreciate the life experience of watching true values lived by in every situation on any day. I deeply miss this truly presidential family leading this country. A country I chose to follow my husband to during his military service. The only regret I have about this book is that despite my pace to enjoy it slowly it came to an end.

  I have always been an MO fan even though I knew very little about her life.  Becoming, is the appropriate title as she shares her life from childhood to present.  I was impressed with her candidness and honesty.  I suppose I could go on but I am not one for a lot of words.  Suffice to say that I enjoyed every word and page.  Now that I know more about her life I totally understand why I liked her in the first place.  Ralph A. Carlson

  Very good book about the ultimate over achievers. Loved her growing up stories, but it surprisingly starts to drag after she Meets Obama. Then it picks back up when she talks about her girls. I guess it’s thumbs up for all the family stuff. Thumbs down on talk about the elections and First Lady policy’s, programs, etc. for me anyway, that gets boring after a few pages. Anyway It’s still good and worth the money.

  My neighborhood book group selected this book. I found it fascinating to learn of the trajectory of Ms. Obama's life; her thoughts were reflective and she learned from the experiences of others around her.  With sharing that she and Barack sought marriage counseling to iron our some time issues in their lives (she was pretty regimented and he was more easy-going), she showed us all that relationships take conscientious intent. She allowed us a peep into the workings of the White House which was illuminating.  I thought the book was a bit on the long side and that some chapters might have been shorter.  This is a worthwhile read.

  I love Michelle Obama and I loved this book. It was entertaining, informative and provided a lovely picture of what formed our forever First Lady. Her life, while not a bed of roses, has certainly had its moments. I was totally jealous of her relationship with her mother. Without her mom she could never have become the woman we so admire. I love her. She made me proud and she wrote a lovely book.

  Sincerely, better than all the hype says. I'm glad I overcame my aversion to reading what ""everyone is reading"". Also glad she spent most of the book on her childhood and the ""getting there"", vs being in Washington. That was interesting too, though. It was all wonderful. Didn't want it to end. It makes me miss the classy, warm, edifying and uplifting Obamas all over again.

  Michelle Obama’s journey is different than mine in many ways. But our common humanity links us, our common experiences as women trying to be successful in a male-dominated professional environment links us,  her care and compassion for all people of all races links us. I found this book to be interesting and challenging, and as a white woman, sometimes a little painful to read; but it is a journey well worth taking and I’m glad I did.

It is a refreshing contrast to the lack of civility and negativity that exists in our current political scene.  Programs and efforts described are real and effective.

  I finished the last 35 pages of Michelle Obama's memoir-to-date yesterday morning, just in time for last night's Book Club meeting.  My one amusing contribution to our discussion was that, while reading Michelle's account of her relationship with Queen Elizabeth, I had a conscious thought that I might be able to reach out to her - to ask her if she would consider arranging an introduction to the Queen in advance of our visit to London next month.  Within seconds of that initial thought, I came to the realization that in spite of the candor and intimacy shared in her book, I don't actually know Michelle Obama, and don't have any better chance of meeting her than I do of meeting Queen Elizabeth.  LOL!

  I was eager to read the book and enjoyed it even more than I thought I would. It was written in a colloquial manner, with a positive spin on most issues. I specifically liked realizing that whether growing up in Chicago, or the Spanish speaking Caribbean,  of different  ethnic descent or economic class, what we learn in our family is what mostly defines us as persons once we become adults. Michelle Obama's parents and mine came from different places,but they shared the same moral principles ,  exerted similar discipline and had similar goals for their children. Education and being decent human beings were most important in both families. They had similar priorities- education and family.  The extended family also played an important role in both our upbringing. While Mrs. Obama's accomplishments exceeded those in my family, I could see glimpses of our upbringing in her story.

  Thank you Michelle Obama for writing this memoir. It is an important American story - A black woman from humble but loving beginnings, who pursued education with all her being and succeeded. Then when a man named Barack walked into you life I could not put the book down!  Then sharing the details of life in the white house, all from teh perspective of a dedicated and caring mother as well as a fully engaged First Lady - fascinating, revealing, vital story. I miss you in the White House but am happy for you that you are in the next phase. Highly recommend!

  I'm so glad I read this book.  Michelle Obama reveals a lady with deeply rooted character, compassion and love.  She lays it all out -the good and the bad with such ease.  While it is easy to relate to her because she is so human, she transcends difficulty in a way that most of us can't bring ourselves to do.  Her remarkable story is an inspiration to all of us to be our better selves.

  Michelle Obama successfully takes you through the journey of her life to date sharing the meaningful and inspiring insights of what it has felt like to come from a humble background in the mid west, be female,  a daughter, a sister, a wife, a mom, a professional and African American as she ascends to her unexpected position as first lady.  It is a book of full of truth, vulnerability, optimism and hope.  It is also an interesting first hand account of the realities of what it felt like to be inside the White House during the 8 years Barrack was in office.  This is an excellent read and an inspiring account of what it means to be an American and truly courageous and powerful human being.  She is an inspiration to us all.

The principles Michelle grew up on, she still carries with her & instills in her children, which is so refreshing to read about.Michelle has a special place in her heart for uplifting youth.  She uplifts me to want to do more.  I'm reading it every night!

  So many nuggets of insight and wisdom that Mrs. Michelle Obama shares in this very heartfelt memoir. Powerful. On the last chapters she talks about visiting Nelson Mandela at 92 years old. He was imprisoned at 44 and released at 71. I thought about this for a few minutes: it's basically being captive from now until my dad's age. 27 years in prison! Unfathomable. My perspective on life as a First Lady has completely changed as a result of reading this book. Highly recommend!

  The book gives a very good insight into the political and social situation leading up to the election of America’s first black president. Also the Obama years are described, but - understandably - not with the president as the main player, but  showing Michelle’s own contribution to effecting change. I found reading the book fascinating.I also listened a bit to the audio version that came with the book. It is great to hear Michelle in her own voice. Great!

You also got a wonderful inside view of living in the White House (no Thank you!). This is really well-written, with vivid stories and thoughtful discourse. What a wonderful human being!

  Memoir of Michelle Obama introduced readers to the life of ordinary people who become great. It's not surprising that this couple has been dubbed - the royal couple. Their popularity and fame continues to spread across the globe because the Obamas are both bestselling authors. Black, cool, and intelligent. Very well written. Great parents.

She is honest about her experiences growing up as a young black woman and the prejudices her family faced, about her concerns for her children growing up in the public arena, and about her learning how to be an effective first lady.  She writes her story in such a personal way with humor and compassion that you feel she is sitting in your home sharing her life.  Becoming gave me greater insight into the life of a woman who overcame the odds to become the First Lady of the United States.

This book forced me to reflect on my own childhood and really look at how we treat each other a people. Laughed a little. Learned a lot. Grateful that she was brave enough to share her story. And I hope it inspires many young women to aspire to be greater than the limits society has placed on them.

  I found the book to be an easy read. I liked getting to know the little girl who grew up in Chicago and eventually became FLOTUS. I wasn't aware of her passion for children and that she and the President tried to incorporate/expose children to activities at the White House. I enjoyed reading about her educational journey, and her resistance to politics. I found her frankness refreshing. I was embarrassed as a white, college educated, middle-class woman to the fact that racial discrimination and gender discrimination still exists.  I appreciate Mrs. Obama's willingness to share her story and family with the reader. After reading the book, I had a deeper appreciation of the sacrifice that each family member makes when their loved one decides to pursue a political role in our country.

  It was so great to learn about Michelle's years growing up and her very strong family life that carried through to her experiences in the White House. She and Barack truly gave us some wonder years while in office that I will be eternally thankful for.. The story  was well written and easy to identify with. I look forward to any other books she might write. Dignity and grace abound here.

  This book is a must read!  It gives you an insight to one of the most historic presidencies & a behind the scene like you never imagined it would be.  I like the personal touches of how they interacted or celebrated with staff that eventually she fondly labeled as family, friends and/or friends of the family.  It definitely doesn't disappoint.  With such grace & kindness the forever our first lady is funny, relatable & though provoking. I'm going to get the audible soon.

  I can’t stress enough how phenomenal this book is. Michelle is at her realest, rawest and everyone needs to read this regardless of their political affiliations. This is a book for the aspiring student, the mothers, for the people within us that want to do more in their lives. You forget that she was the First Lady and for a moment you think she’s just another somebody looking for her place in life. It’s wonderful. I’m not a crier, but I cried a few times somehow. It’s not politics-heavy I promise.

She allowed me to feel as close to her as a cousin or a sister, even as I regarded her as a ‘star’ in life.  She’s so easy to get close to.  And, the insight into her husband made me proud, and gave me hope that we are all uniquely qualified to leave a legacy of hope, courage, goodness and love.

I can’t even imagine how hard it must be to choose to go high when so many people around you are hitting low blows every chance they get. All the people who treated her and President Obama with so much disrespect and tried to stand in the way of every initiative they took to improve our country, need to read this book so they can hopefully realize that she and her family are like all Americans who love our country.  We love our family, and we forge our way through life with hopes and dreams to make things better for everyone.  It’s a great book. I wish I could meet her and President Obama in person.

I would recommend this book to everyone- because I think there is a lot to take away and I suspect I’ll take something different on each read.It’s not set out to be inspirational. Michelle simply asks that you listen to her story in the way she wants it told. I found insights into not only politics but also the actual people involved in implementing those politics. Insights into not only Barack Obama the president but also into Barack the man & how he thinks. Insights not only into life as the first family but also into motherhood, parenting decisions and sacrifices.There is plenty more and I will definitely be rereading this!

  I was totally captivated by this whole book.  It is not only grammatically so well written but is excellent literature.  I have some issues with her discussion of the Whitehouse years. I found those most illuminating about all the various issues that she involved herself particularly with young women and her own children.The early years growing up on the South Side of Chicago were riveting as I have some familiarity with the area. I cannot recommend this book more highly.

  I loved the Obamas the moment I learn about them, when Barack Obama became President of the USA.  They are an amazing couple, and this book has made me love them even more.  And it has made me wonder even more how the citizens of the USA elected Trump after the Obamas...impossible to answer...

So refreshing to read after witnessing the utter chaos that is currently occupying our White House and gives me hope that one day our White House will again be occupied by someone who has our country’s best interest at heart.

  Great book!! I will say it is good but It is not a book that can’t put down. While it is interesting it is taking me a little longer to read. But it goes over how she felt about herself as a black woman, working mom and wife. Talks about how different people in her life helped her realize things and gave her perspective. I can relate to her on some things while other things I don’t.

It is very well-written and interesting; I couldn’t put it down. She does an excellent job balancing her story with Barack’s, the light with the heavy, the public with the private. It’s great to find out more about Michelle’s life, and to see Barack’s ascent and presidency through her eyes.

I loved her authenticity and vulnerability in sharing her journey of self doubt and wondering ""Am I good enough?"" The fear of losing her identify as her husband became the Commander in Chief and how at the end of the day her responsibility and commitment to being a good mother never wavered. She is such an amazing woman!

It not only gives you an insightful look at Michelle, her life, and her journey as First Lady, but it causes you to reflect on your own journey. I love the way she brings her journey into yours regardless of its differences and/or similarities! I admire her balanced perspective of optimism and reality ; seeing what is good and hopeful and not down playing or ignoring harsh realities of an imperfect world. That is hard to do and is what makes her to me an inspiration for all who can realize where you start your journey is not as important as where your journey takes you.

  Michelle’s Obama memoir is a great reflective narrative. Life and destiny are indeed engineered by God himself. The author through her story has proven anybody/everyone can become all they were created and endowed to become. This book is a great motivation for the “girl child.” She can rise above all the entrenched patriarchal biases, odds and labels to exploit her potential to the highest. The language in the book is strong, simple and understandable even with author writing with a lawyer’s mind. All things considered, it’s a great educative read.

The author through her story has proven anybody/everyone can become all they were created and endowed to become. This book is a great motivation for the “girl child.” She can rise above all the entrenched patriarchal biases, odds and labels to exploit her potential to the highest. The language in the book is strong, simple and understandable even with author writing with a lawyer’s mind. All things considered, it’s a great educative read.

  This book by Mrs. Obama is beautifully written. She has a wonderful way of telling the personal side of life before and during her time as First Lady.  I learned a lot, and am so proud of her, and look forward to what she will continue to do on behalf of our country, and the world.

  This memoir by First Lady, Michelle Obama, feels like a chat between girlfriends, if you have an intelligent, funny, gracious, thoughtful, amazing best girlfriend. Sigh. Having excellence in the highest levels of our government is missed. Recommended, especially the audiobook because she is the narrator, and it feels like she's talking to just to you.

  I partly listened to the audio-version and read this book. *Btw, Michelle Obama reads the audio; sometimes I found that boring and other times inspiring.  I found it very insightful when Mrs. Obama describes her years living in The White House.  She's not a pedestal First Lady, she's actually quite accomplished and I admire her for that in itself.  She used big words sometimes, that I was thankful for a thesaurus,  but she really impresses me inside and out.

  Michelle Obama’s journey from childhood to White House is certainly inspiring. I was continually amazed at her steadiness in the face of so much racial backlash . Here was a woman who leveraged her position for nothing but good, uplifting everyone she met, and not pandering to those institutions that felt she owed them her appearance.

This memoir brings her worries to light. Through her open vulnerability, Michelle Obama allows the reader to understand her fear of not being good enough, whether as a student, mother, or spouse. The honesty of her voice gives a glimpse into the heart of a beautiful, compassionate woman who portrays elegant strength in facing the challenges of her extremely public life.

  I had not really decided what to expect about this book, and hoped it was not full of Political mumbo jumbo.  I was not disappointed, as it was very refreshing to real an honest account of life in the Political fast lane, as a reluctant politicians partner.  Some wonderful family descriptions throughout the book, of colourful characters.  Would definitely recommend.

  Loved this look into the experiences that shaped Michelle.  Found it quite interesting that the University of Chicago had this kind of talent just outside the gates of the college but never reached out into the neighborhood to even explore the value of recruitment of students from that area.

  MIchelle Obamas story is inspiring to see what parental love and belief in education can do to not waste a mind.  She can be proud of giving back to society what was invested in her by her parents. Makes you think about the hurdles the majority of the world faces not being born white and protected by money and connections.

  In really glad I read Becoming.  It was quite a revelation seeing things through Michelle's prospective.  A look behind the veil at life in the White House.  Seeing how much she had to overcome and how hard she had to work to go to Princeton and Harvard and  get her law degree inspired me.  The sacrifices she and Barak made as president and first lady.  And the many successful initiatives she began while in office.  Very surprising and inspiring.

  This book was purchased as a Christmas gift for a family member (I have not personally read it yet). She loved it and said she highly recommended it. I ordered it right before Christmas, with 2 day Prime, and it came right away! I LOVE Amazon Prime for those last-minute gifts!!! Don't know what I'd do with Prime!

  I've truly enjoyed this book.  It is very well written and reflects the intelligence of the woman who wrote it.  I have an even deeper appreciation for the Obamas now that I have more of the back story.  I hope they both continue to stay active in serving the people of this country in whatever capacity their hearts lead them to do so.  Most importantly - this book has encouraged me to continue to do what I can to make a positive impact.  Buy the book.  Read it.  Encourage others to read it.

  This is a beautiful and very moving story from a woman I still hope will one day be the president. We need her now more than ever. This is an autobiography that’s different than the others I’ve read before. She’s so open and authentic it really resonated with me and left me feeling very empowered.This book has touched my heart. As Barack once said: I love her and I can’t wait for the rest of the world to fall in love with her. Well I did. What a great woman.

  I really enjoyed the book. Michelle was not ""the little woman,"" standing behind her (impt) man. She was very well educated in a top ivy league university & law school, then hired by a prestigious law firm-- all before Obama even earned his law degree.  Women can easily relate to Michelle's struggles to balance family & her own career goals... until her husband becomes President! It's an interesting story, well told.

However, the first copy I received had the following 16 poorly printed or no-print pages: 178, 180, 181, 183, 186, 188, 189, 191, 194, 196, 197, 199, 202, 204, 205, 207.  Amazon sent me a replacement with the same 16 poorly printed pages!  I returned the second defective book but was notified in one email they received the book and in a second email they had not received the book and they would charge me again for the book.  Lesson learned: Check to make sure a book is printed correctly when ordering from Amazon - this is the first time I have ever purchased a defective book in over 70 years of reading books.

  I liked that she grew up and lived in the south side of Chicago and went on to be the First Lady and live in the White House. I grew up in Chicago too and I felt that it was a very hard core place to live. I remember the violences at the riots at the democratic convention. And riots at northwestern university. People are so prejudice and close minded and they don’t help each other. Chicago has only gotten worse. I am for no guns in the streets, businesses and homes of America. More mental health education and no drugs. I gave it 5 stars for writing honestly and trying to change some of the things that need to be changed.

  Reading about the evolution of Michele Obama from a southside Chicago childhood to the First Lady was fascinating and inspiring.  In the turmoil of today's presidency, I felt a comfort in reading about rational, purposeful individuals and their pathways to their current selves. The book was well written and seemed direct and honest.  This should be ""must"" reading for young women re: the development of their own life story and as an introduction to politics on the personal level.

  Becoming was a well written account of what it's like to be drawn into the world of politics and being the first lady! Not only the first lady, but the first African American First Lady of The United States. Mrs. Obama shares poignant emotions, personal insights, reflections and attitudes about her journey into the White House. I would highly recommend reading this extraordinary work of The journey to BECOME!

  Ms. Obama's words confirm what I saw in tv interviews. She is strong, loving, caring and loyal to her family, friends and country. She leads me to be motivated to speak out more in praise of others good works and to educate my community in matters of bullying and bigotry and social injustices. This was an honest and positive read about our current society.

  My takeaway is that this book should be on the shelf of every young girl.  It's a wonderful, true story that anyone can succeed even when coming from humble beginnings. Michelle has given us a raw, honest account of the rewards and difficulties to be encountered by those who have the courage to follow their dreams.  This is a well written look at some of the most private aspects of her family's lives and her own private thoughts.  I found that I couldn't put it down and I was sad when it ended.

  Although Michelle Obama’s national prominence and celebrity is due to her marriage with the United States First African-American President, more significantly, is the old phrase “Behind Every Strong Black Man, is a Strong Black Woman”. Understanding this simple quote, intrigued me to learn about the strength, the resiliency, the true of root of the legacy that the Obama’s will leave on this world. And like everything they touched, this book authored by the First Lady was nothing short of a generational masterpiece.

I am grateful for all that the Obama family has done to improve the quality of life of so many Americans & also for others around the world. Their patriotism, integrity and conscientiousness are truly appreciated. I hope more folks read this book!

  I loved it for the memories of growing up Midwestern, for that constraint refrain of ""am I good enough?"" which touches all of us in such a personal way, for reminding us why decency matters so much. My daughter-in-law, wanting to do so much like Michelle Obama, loved it for all the signposts along the road, my husband is loving it, partway through so I haven't yet asked why. Certainly a book with something for everyone, and when you finish you feel energised. Thank you Michelle Obama, what a gift to us.

  An amazing journey from a small apartment on the south side of Chicago to the First Lady of the United States living in the White House.  Instead of a famous person I see on television at a distance, she feels like a normal woman who I think I would enjoy being friends with.  I really enjoyed reading her story.  Was very well written and I was never bored.  Worth the time and money to read.

  Michelle Obama takes you on a journey of her childhood to her 8 years as First Lady.  She did not grow up in a life of privilege as many of our previous First Ladies.  Her story is honest and uplifting. She makes you feel that anything in life is possible if you want it bad enough. It just takes persistence and hard work.

  Michelle Obama is the real thing, so authentic and honest.  She shares her humble home life , that I can relate to.  She says that faith is what keeps all of her fears at bay.  She shows us what a family does to keep their relationships honest.  She describes a family where family time is the most important time.  She reminds us to be our true, authentic being.  None of us should hold back stories of love for humanity, for people different than us.  She predicts the darkness that surrounds us with our current President.  All of us need to think not party am I, but which person will lead us to democracy, to honesty and respect for everyone.  We do not need a dictator.

  Becoming offers Michelle Obama's unique perspective on growing from Southside Chicago to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Her priorities are clear, and her heart is definitely in the right place. I admired her more after reading how she managed to raise her children and sustain herself and her marriage in the intense fishbowl of the White House.

  From the first line of Becoming, I felt as though I were sitting on a bean bag in her dorm room listening to her chat. Her love for our country, the American people, her family, her friends and those who work for and with her is most inspiring.

  This seemed like she was trying to explain and defend herself more than anything, but I still really enjoyed it. At times, it seemed a little self-congratulatory; almost bragging about sacrifices she chose to make. However, this was another book that I couldn't put down. I thought the writing was above average and her story flowed well - I enjoyed getting to know our former first lady on a somewhat personal basis.

I appreciated her ability to admit when she was wrong and hold tight to her values when she was challenged.

  This is possibly the best book I’ve read in the past twenty years. So many times people I’ve really liked and admired from afar become “fallen idols “ when you get to know more about them. Not so with Michelle Obama. She is just the person I thought and hoped she would be. That gives me great hope for the future. 😊

  Beautifully written-as direct and strong as she is.  Very captivating fairytale, until the end when the presidency is lost to the other side.  I envied Michele‘s upbringing--low on material but high on love and support and belief in her ability to do it all.  I inhaled it in four days-a great read.

  I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to be reminded about hope. This work of art reminds us that we are all connected. We all have a story to tell. We can all reach out and help one another. We can all speed the words of hope and possibility, no matter how small the platform. Even if it's just reaching out to a neighbor, to get to know them. Love this book. A must read and read again!!!

  This is a polished, authentic look into an admirable life. Written with balance and yet telling it the way she sees it, Michelle Obama has offered a true gift. She showed restraint at many points, and still managed to land her points with intelligence and precision. She went high, and anyone who reads this might find their inner bar raises at least a little for it. I know mine has. I pray this country can hear what she is saying. We need to.

  If you're a Trump fan you should avoid this book.  Personally, I found myself admiring the way the Obamas navigated the challenges of raising a family in the White House.  So much better than the crime syndicate that infests the first residence.  Just for perspective, some of the other first families I admire are those of Teddy Roosevelt, George W. Bush, and Harry Truman.

It was well worth waiting for, and I am very happy to have my very own copy.The book begins with Michelle's childhood, and encompasses her life story up until leaving the Whitehouse. Her story comes from the heart, and it's an easy read - not full of fancy jargon that one might need  dictionary to understand. I must say I knew the Obama's were different from run of the mill politicians I had become accustomed to. She and Barack are very intelligent; yet humble and down to earth and care deeply about helping others.I just loved this book!

This book provided me with profound joy and sadness simultaneously—The joy of reliving the dream come true for so many of us for those 8 years and the immense sadness over the way in which it ended. In this regard the book was at times almost unbearable to read but we all know that the price we pay for the privilege of love is inevitably confrontation with pain, loss, and sadness.

Clearly he is exactly the kind of person needed for the job, and exactly the opposite of the person who has unfortunately succeeded him.

She was very honest and open to talk about her feelings and how she felt they would never win the primary. She explains her side of the story very well. Growing up not having as much resources to get somewhere in life, she was very driven! I loved the story and how things changed after Barack came into her life. A lot of the behind the scenes I wouldnt have thought about or even imagined it. She gave a pretty good insight on how their lives were after Barack became president.

  Michelle Obama’s memoir is well-written, sharp, funny, and tear-jerking. It’s honest, and she writes herself as strong & intelligent, yet slightly self-deprecating. Her words and her life story make me admire her even more than I did before, and her eloquent storytelling pulls you in as soon as you begin reading.

  To learn from the REAL FIRST LADY and not the tabloids or sensationalism from the media. Powerful from beginning til ending. Passed the book on to a Native American family. They started reading the book and quickly returned mine within two days. Told me that her story related so much that they wanted their own copy for future generations because ""a woman of color did it and we agreed, with so much Grace and kindness. Looked what she accomplished and how she inspired so many."" I couldn't put this history book down. Thank you.

  How to write a review about the life of someone so admirable?? It is difficult. I love that she watches HGTV and ""say yes to the dress"". This book emphasized her humanity. She shared when she was scared or worried or was just being a mom/daughter/wife. It is well written, humorous, touching and inspirational.

I enjoyed her honesty and transparency. I loved the accounts of her childhood and the people in it. I loved the grace with which it was written, and I feel that this is the same ease and grace she carried herself through both of the Obama presidential terms. I appreciate Michelle and am grateful to have learned so much more about her and her family in this book.

  I was an Obama supporter from day one and I admired the way their 8 years were handled.  But getting to ""know"" Mrs. Obama and the backstory was very moving to me!  I laughed & cried out loud in places and very few books can do that!  I think it was an honest, from-the-heart chronicle of Mrs. Obama's life - not trying to sugar coat anything, no hyperbole and no negativity!  I enjoyed reading it!

  This was such an engrossing story of a young black girl from the south side of Chicago becoming an accomplished, caring, hopeful, patriotic woman. The fact that she becomes the first African-American First Lady of the United States is just a bonus for our country and the world. The book is honest, personal and full of insights into this wonderful woman and her husband, who just happens to be the former President of the US!

  Michelle Obama writes with a down to earth style, that seems honest and humble. Her story is an interesting one about an intelligent over achiever from Chicago’s South Side who admits to making plenty of mistakes but continues to learn and grow into the admirable mom, leader, and advocate so many of us have come to admire.

I enjoyed the insight into both the personal and professional pieces of being in the White House. It gave me more respect for anyone who is elected president of our nation and the sacrifices that are made daily. I think the most beautiful part of the book was the thread of hope and sacrifice- her belief in his ability to be a leader for our nation and putting that before her own desires was a beautiful thing to read about.

  Michelle Obama, you have probably heard this so many times but I just have to say it again “you and your family have been the most positive inspiration to so many.”  I would recommend all to read this book as the experiences shared are so relatable to so many of us.  It gives hope in a time of uncertainty for so many of us.  I especially like the reference to life as a progression of continuous growth.  There are so many layers in this book.  It is touching, real, strong and humble.  The story is spoken from the heart.  Just beautiful!

  This book is filled with hope. It's fantastic to read the story of how a young girl from Chicago's south side made her way up and then changed tracks to serve the public and help bring enormous changes. The romance story with Barack is adorable. I appreciate that Michelle changes her tone throughout the book to accurately convey her past feelings, even if she does not associate with them anymore -- it keeps the narrative real.

It is a wonderful glimpse of life from her younger days in Chicago and winds its way till her final moments in the White House. We may think we know her because of her public life but we don’t.

  An intriguing view from inside the White House looking out.  The book is well written and easy to read- almost as if you are chatting with the First Lady.  Clearly the author has a bias and she makes no attempt to “convince” anyone into her way of thinking.  She just unapologetically shares her personal history, from childhood through the end of Barack’s presidency.  Getting to know her and her husband through Michelle’s eyes provided me with additional insights into the President and the personal motivations that drove his policy.

They both raised great daughters in the White House environment.  Mrs. Obama's narration draws you into her life, including the White House days. I wrestled whether to use the title ""Mrs"" for both of this ladies because readers may interpret this as a fake approval; they both deserve the respect that they gave to the American public. I am proud to say this one the best ""autobiography"" type books I have read!!!

  BECOMING was one of the most important books I have ever read.  Mrs. Obama tells how to start from  a simple life and become one of the most important women in the world.  During this growth, she and her husband continued to do the right things for the right reasons.  I admire both of them.

  Thank you, Michelle, for sharing your story with us.This is an amazing memoir for present and future generations, providing a lense and tone that encourages the reader to honor their past and submit to the journey of becoming a leader in all their spheres of influence.I loved how, in her own way, she honored her family, Barack, children and friends. I'm also glad she made the courageous step to continue to use her voice, tell HER story, in vulnerability and without agenda :D #iambecoming

  A beautifully written book that I’d highly recommend to anyone! Michelle Obama is remarkable! That said, this book is poorly printed. The printer was clearly running out of ink, as some pages are so light I could hardly read the words. On other pages, the words were dark and splotchy. It felt like I was reading a bootlegged book. Maybe I should stick to a Kindle...

  I appreciated her profound honesty, the revealing of her weaknesses and strengths, how she and Barack fought hard to protect their children without being helicopter parents---giving them room to grow in their own personal styles. I appreciated her great love and respect for her extended family members and theirs for her. I very much admired her lack of interest in politics and having little desire to be on display. At the same time, I so wish she were running for president of the USA. She would be a winner.

  It was interesting to know more about Ms. Obama's background and early days in Chicago. She's written before about her campaign experiences and actually living in the White House, but it was all here in one place. The only thing I didn't like is that she errs, quite obviously an perhaps wisely, on the side of caution; it isn't possible for her not to have strong opinions on most subjects.

  I had no real expectations when I started reading Becoming but boy was I blown away!  I read a lot and almost never leave a review but this book touched me.  Michelle tells her story with the class and dignity that surrounds the Obamas.  I can’t tell you how profoundly this book affected me.  I will pass it along to my daughters and tell all my friends to read it.  Very impactactful and uplifting even while keenly observing the somewhat sad state of politics.  Left me feeling hopeful - in Michelle’s own words, “change happens slowly” but we can still strive to make it better.

But if I had somehow  managed to read this memoir without knowing who the author was, or the basic history, it would be impossible to come away without liking her.  Her story rings just as true and sincere as her persona has seemed to be in the public arena over the years. She brought a new level of candor and grace to the role of First Lady. A real pleasure to read her thoughts about and responses to recent historical events as they unfolded.

  Interesting and informative view inside the White House by a family of modest means. Michelle is someone who proves that a better life can be found. Even if she didn’t end up as our First Lady, she is still a shining example of how to live a positive, thoughtful, loving existence.

  I wondered about reading this, but I shouldn’t have. If only I could read more autobiographies of Black women with strong families of origin, artistic, professional and educational achievements, in a strong and successful marriage, committed to her children, working for social good, and with values I share and work for.  I would be happier. The fact that she was the First Lady and her husband the first Black president is secondary.  If you want to read the book, include the audio track. Hearing the story told by the author is an added benefit.

  Michelle Obama will go down in history as one the best First Ladies ever to occupy the White House. In this book she describes those people and events that formed her character. Her account feels honest and sincere, and pulls no punches when describing her life with Barack (not always easy) and the mistakes in judgment she made in her career. Her strength, integrity, dignity and humility come through in this detailed account of her life...so far.

  This was my first audiobook purchase.  I have to say, I looked forward to each trip, regardless how short, so that I could hear more from Mrs Obama.  It was a joy to discover her story, but much of the beauty came from hearing it in her own words.  I never thought I would be that excited to hear a book.  I’ve always been a bit of a traditionalist and independent as I have always wanted to read it myself.

The issue I have with the physical book itself, is that pages (about20) were so very poorly printed -very light - as to make them unreadable.  Groups of these pages were scattered throughout the text.  I have never experienced this before.  Would this be the responsibility of the publisher or just the printer?Did anyone else receive a defective copy?Thanks, in advance, for any responses.

She has such love for her family AND her country and was willing to give up a lot to support her husband in his efforts to make the world a better place.

  I finally downloaded this while at home sick and I couldn't be happier I did. It reads like advice from a trusted older friend or mentor, leading readers through moments and stories that everyone can empathize with. It had moments that are private, personal, emotional, and many stories that made me think. Though she's the first to admit in her memoir that she's not a fan of politics, First Lady Michelle Obama's smart, strong, empathetic, and capable voice is needed now more than ever. I'm glad I got to hear her voice through this book.

  Because of the tremendous detail of how Michelle Obama became who she is today and the honesty of the difficulties encountered in many aspects, but without any whining, made this book a reminder of how women--and especially women of color have had to maneuver in a white male dominated world. The most impacting aspect of the book is the stark contrast with the current potus . Nothing intentional in words but one cannot help but do a mental comparison while reading. Well worth my time post holidays.

Balancing marriage and motherhood with a demanding career is something that we women deal with (some of us better than others). It's one of those books that I know I will read again. She is beautiful, intelligent humble and kind and a wonderful role model for girls/women all over the world. It was so descriptive that I could picture in my mind everything she described as if I were there and I couldn't put the book down until I finished.  Well done! ☺

  Michelle Obama captures the hope and she serves as an inspiration for young women in becoming better versions of themselves. I share a very similar background to Michelle and appreciated her putting into words how hard she worked and her singleness of purpose as a young woman. She was driven and hard working but supported by a loving family. Without giving away too much in the book, I will say I loved her honesty and openness in discussing the personal details of her life. Great read and I suggest all young women read it for a great perspective on being a strong modern woman with a family.

  This book is incredible. Michelle Obama is a remarkable woman and human being. Her insights were such good reminders for me. Her words give me hope for the future of our country and help me to realize that cynicism is not helpful. To live his/her best life one must have hope, determination, empathy, grace and positivity!  She has all of these qualities and is a wonderful example for all women (and men!).

  I didn't know what to expect from the former FLOTUS book, and found that her style of writing was outstanding, felt authentic, and kept me wanting to read more. Surprisingly, I felt like I understood and related to many of her stories - even though I have little in common with her life. I would highly recommend this book as an entertaining, well-written glimpse into the life of an interesting, smart, warm and genuine leader who blazed new trails during my lifetime.

If it were not true word for word, it would be a modern fairy tale—one grounded in such basic human truths as to make it a story to be told over and over for generations to come. I highly recommend this journey of a woman who very much inspired one of the finest presidents this country will ever know.

  Michelle Obama is a highly educated articulate woman. She tells her story in a very human manner, never forgetting how she started. Perhaps that is what makes this such an excellent book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to others.

  Overall, Becoming was just ok. The cheap shots she took at the Republican party was annoying and unnecessary. The first eight chapters were difficult to get through, but it does get better about halfway through. The ending was decent, minus, again, all the cheap shots she took at anyone she disagreed with. I doubt she intended to portray herself as such a high maintenance person, but I sensed that on countless occasions. I was hoping for a more encouraging message, with insight into her life as the FLOTUS, (and it did give some), but for the most part, she basically repeated the same thing the entire time: it's hard being black, it's hard being a woman, it's especially hard being black AND a woman, white men are the devil, my husband's never home. I understand it's difficult to open up and be so vulnerable in writing, but she sounded like she had a chip on her shoulder the whole time. I felt put off by the ""us versus them"" tone she portrayed talking about different ethnicities. She had such a strong message about how oppressed black people are, that she seemed annoyed with anything white or male, and even more annoyed if that subject was both. She mentions a few times about how wrong people were about her, portraying her as an angry black woman. But...that was basically her tone throughout most of the book. Her voice sounded miffed, annoyed, resentful, mad. I wanted to like this book, and I'd hoped it would broaden my mind and views on politics, but it didn't do much of that. It's great that she started a garden, and introduced beekeeping, and started those programs for the children. I wish she'd focused more on that and less on just how difficult she thinks all black people have it. The writing in this book is mostly flat, not at all exceptional. With all due respect, I believe this book is only getting the attention it is because of who she is.

Her telling of her feelings are straight from her heart. Her details of what it’s like to life in the White House were amazing. But the bottom line is she is an awesome woman, mother, wife, and leader and she doesn’t tell her story with bravado but with honesty you’d get if you were having a cup of tea with her.

  Your selflessness in itself in an encouragement to many of us new immigrants who often are made to feel as a 4th category of citizens. Regardless of how much we contribute to this country, we will never really be citizens. We will always because of our accents be called upon to first answer the question “where are you from?” before we can be labeled as “just another naturalization case”!

  Normally I do not like memoirs, however; this was written so well that even though you know the outcomes you still want to know what happens next. Several reviews have said it was sad. I don’t understand that at all as there is Hope woven into all of it. What’s sad is how far away we are now from the positive influences described in this memoir. Excellent reading!

This is the first book I listened to rather than read and having Mrs Obama telling her own story in her own voice is powerful and fitting.

  This remarkable memoir exudes personality, kindness, dignity, and class--as most people might expect from the former First Lady.  Once begun, you will find yourself lost in her world from childhood through her departure from the White House. what a treat!

  Excellent book.  It reads as if you are having a conversation with her.  It shows how resilient she was and is.  It gives a different, more candid perspective of what people of color continue to go through on an almost daily basis.  Even with their differences the Obamas work through their ups and downs together.  They compliment each other. Family is so important to both of them.  Her frustrations about the report on what she is wearing overshadowing the true meaning of the meeting or activity she was attending gives one a better understanding of what it means to ""live in a fishbowl.""

I liked the way she put the story together.  I enjoyed the book immensely and had trouble putting it down sometimes.

  Being an old white woman born in the south I found the story of a young black girl eye opening. A totally  different perspective was  informative and interesting insight into a world unknown and yet parallel with my young life. I found it refreshingly honest and frank. I have recommended it to both family and friends. Considering rereading it to aid my understanding of the opposite political positions of several subjects.

We all have the same color underneath, it doesn't hurt to smile, say hello, or maybe hold the door for someone.I worked for a school District in a poor area, I found all the children to be the same color, not one being different from the other.  We all need to pull together to make this country work.

Through every experience she shared, one can understand and feel new dimensions of the ongoing internal struggles we continue to go through to “fit” and flourish together.

  It was clear Michelle Obama spoke from her heart.  She was honest, vulnerable and poignant.  Her insight into the 44th historical presidency covered the spectrum of what inspired us and shocked us to our core.  She took us on a historical journey of the courage and ugliness of race relations in America like few ever could.  She lived it and it’s her truth to tell.  She inspired me throughout her 8 years as FLOTUS and she inspires me with her story.  Mahalo nui loa

  I liked the true stories, especially the one where the Obamas found themselves in Butte, Montana, a city rarely in the news. My parents were born and raised there and our family spent a one-time vacation there on the 4th of July exactly 50 years before the Obamas. This is the most well-written memoir by a ""celebrity"" that I have ever read. Michelle isn't just tooting her own horn, she is leaving breadcrumbs for future generations of girls and under-privileged others as to how to work and study their way into the American Dream.

  I enjoyed viewing many of the events of the Obama years through Michelle’s commentary. The time they were in office was an evolutionary tome for our nation in so many ways. It is clear from the boom that their jobs were never easy but always hopeful.

  The great part of Michelle Obama’s story telling is how she reflects on the world around her as she writes about her own experiences. From her growing up in a middle class black family in Southside Chicago, to her career, her marriage, her difficulties in getting pregnant and on to FLOTUS, she provides a reflection of contemporary women’s issues, particularly for women of color.

  I loved the story of her childhood with a solid family core.  Sorry Michelle missed her opportunity while in the White House to work towards furthering the importance of marriage in the black family.So often Michelle would start her subject or object in the sentence with her name first, followed by ""and so and so"".  Aren't they teaching grammar in schools anymore?

Michelle's upbringing as a child was not so different as mine, in my mind I could literally see a movie unfolding. The ups and downs, Southside, I loved that they named their grandfather. Her movie, my movie, and I'm sure so sure many others could relate. I honestly hated for the book to end. But then again, it hasn't!

  Very nicely structured around the theme(s) of becoming (for instance -- herself when young in Chicago; us when she meets Barack Obama). Believable story of grit, persistence, and insight.

  One can't blame Mrs. Obama for being oh-so careful about what she reveals in this book about herself and her family. Even her nail polish was criticized by the public. I particularly like the way she seems to admire her mother. I wish she had showed us more of her feelings about this amazing life and perhaps less of the action involved. How she felt instead of just what she did.

I am a white woman, I grew up in a privileged suburb of California, yet I feel a kinship with Michelle’s worldview. I laughed in places and cried in others. I not only learned a lot about her, also about her experiences as a woman of color in a white man’s world. Educational and Enjoyable.

  As amazing and inspiring as the Obamas were, getting a glimpse at the life of the First Lady makes them even more relatable and inspiring. I truly miss having an intellectual family at the The White House. Reading her book brings back some of the hope that was lost since they left the White House. Her memoir is truly amazing, as we could have expected. None of the negative reviews are verified purchases, it’s just people being hateful. They haven’t learned, “they go low we go high!”

Her memoir is truly amazing, as we could have expected. None of the negative reviews are verified purchases, it’s just people being hateful. They haven’t learned, “they go low we go high!”

  This book was not a superficial “read”. It took me on an in-depth and intriguing journey with Michelle and her family as they navigated their unique ways through our wonderful/terrible cultural maze. I highly recommend it to anyone who does not know what it is like to be perceived as “ the other” as well as how to prevail and make something beautiful of your life.

  I cannot begin to express what this book means to me.  It is written with such clarity that allows you to feel the hopes, dreams, and struggles felt by the First Lady.  It allowed me to understand that there are others who question if they are good enough.  I will be forever grateful for the openness and honesty I believe this book portrayed.

  Michelle Obama’s story is so truthful and raw. The way she shares her time as First Lady through her own eyes is a treat, as it is rare that we get to see past the President and into what his family endures. I am grateful for her sharing and would love nothing more than to have Michelle over for dinner. This is one of the most well-written books I have ever had the pleasure of reading.

  I have always admired Michelle Obama as a woman, wife, mother & First Lady.  There were never any pretenses in all those roles....what you saw is what you got. She is a good example of always striving to be what you want to be, not expecting anything to be handed to you. I would recommend this book to all my friends and relatives, regardless of their ages or political persuasions.  It is truly the story of any American girl & what she can accomplish in her life, if she wants to. Thank you for sharing, Michelle, it was a joy getting to know you.

  Michelle Obama is more unfiltered here than she had the luxury of being as First Lady, and that is a real gift. It’s such a lovely insight into her family/upbringing, her drive, her relationship with her husband, and what it is like to live in the spotlight as the spouse of the most powerful person on earth while also being an equally competent and powerful individual in her own world. This is a must read!

To read about all that she had to endure, along with her two beautiful and smart daughters, not to mention President Barack Obama, has made me even prouder of my first Family.I highly recommend this book.

  The book showed the human side of Michelle and Barack Obama.  Michelle was very honest about the ups and downs of her life and she pointed out how she had to have an especially high value system to compensate for being black.  It showed that the sky is the limit with hard work and good work habits.  I could not put the book down because I wanted to follow the path to the White House and beyond.

Authentic, engaging story telling that has given me greater insight into the struggles and triumphs that Black people in this country face. Michelle knows she is fortunate to have been raised in a family that supported her in every way. Her understanding of this advantage and desire to want to lift up others is truly remarkable.

  This was a gift for my wife of 40 years.  She has always respected Michelle Obama, after reading the book, she said her respect for her had multiplied ten times over!  Becoming Michelle is a perfect title.  Mrs. Obama grew up in humble circumstances, probably unrecognizable to many people.  To achieve what she has in her life is proof it's not where you come from, but what YOU DO that matters!

She did not spend the majority of the book talking about Barrack or even the politics, but on herself and how she became Michelle Robinson Obama. 10/10 recommend for everyone - regardless of political ID.

  Although the book was excellent, I was very disappointed to find that this book had many blank (or the print so faint to be unreadable!) pages starting in Chapter 13.  It’s hard to believe the publisher was not aware of these defects, and I am surprised Amazon would ship such an important book with parts unreadable.  I don’t know what to do, but this is NOT the hardcover copy of “Becoming” that I would like to share with my daughters and keep for posterity!

  Michelle Obama eloquently narrates her life story from striving for excellence out of south side Chicago to being catapulted into the public eye as first lady. Her commitment to public service and her ability to advocate for those that don't have a voice are beautifully intertwined in an autobiography which I couldn't put down! Her message, life lessons, and principles are ones we should all strive for: love, respect, and hard work!

  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book. I have never felt so strongly about a book since reading ""When Breath Becomes Air"" by Dr Paul Kalanithi. It has made me laugh and cry; made me feel anger and pride. It is universal that even if it shines light on US politics, the message is clear for anyone, anywhere. Mostly, it gives hope and allows one to dream of possibilities... which is what we all wish for when we open a good book and leaf through its pages to read.

  Michelle Obama is not only one of the best and inspiring First Ladies we have ever had,but has proven to be a great author as well.  I felt like I was beside her every step of the way!  She draws the reader into her journey, and I began to feel as if I was one of her best friends!With all the doom & gloom we have had these past two years, with Donald Trump at the helm, I have hope in our future!  Thank you, Michelle

  Beautifully written. I often avoid autobiographies (and biographies) because they are not always well-written, and can become dry and lost in the weeds of minute details. Mrs. Obama wrote this with great care, especially in her description of your childhood. I felt like I was there, in that small apartment, seeing her father’s health decline, but knowing she was loved and cherished. I can’t stop saying “beautifully written”.  I can’t recommend it enough!

  This book was a great read. So informative.  I enjoyed following Michelle's life from a little girl through the White House Years.  Her family was just a normal family with parents that allowed the kids to follow their dreams and make their own mistakes.Yet they were there guiding them in case they strayed too far. They were not wealthy or privileged in any way.  Michelle and her brother achieved their success and fame through hard work.

  Michelle Obama's story in ""Becoming"" is the first ray of light since the unforgettable election day of 2016. This book gently brings to surface what had been nearly invisible these past few years: reminders of the importance of optimism, respect, and hard work—especially in the context of community. Thank you, Michelle, for sharing your voice with us in such a tender way.

  This book was very good. Michelle made me feel like, I was right there. She brought her story to life.  I could visualize the family gatherings. She made me think of tines with my granny. I am thankful that she wasn't embarrassed of where she came from. Michelle is a prime example of, no mattter your race; you can be anything that you want to be. Thank you former First Lady Obama. You have made our race proud!

  I found this book to be so much more than just a biography of a First Lady. Michelle Obama is such a strong woman, a woman who took advantage of all opportunities that came her way. Along with that came her responsibility to leave the door open for others. A public persona as well as a flawed human being.

  Michelle draws you into her life from the first paragraph! Her childhood experiences in urban Chicago were quite similar to mine in rural Iowa a generation earlier. What a talented, compassionate, and exceptional person Michelle Obama is, and how blessed we were to have her as an admirable First Lady. About halfway through the book, I began rationing how much I read each day, just to make every page last longer.

  Becoming was a book that I was not sure whether or not I was going to enjoy.  But from the very first chapter, it was well written.  She was able to put her emotions into the book along with what was happening to her.  She must have an excellent memory to remember all the things that happened to her, even if she did keep some kind of diary.i especially liked how she put her husband into human form, rather that just “Mr President”,

  Michelle Obama’s story is uplifting, compelling and beautiful. I love her message and passion towards uplifting others. It stands clear to me that she knows exactly what our struggling communities need, and that is for each and every individual to know that we all matter and we can make a change.

  When I met Michelle Obama while working on her husband's first campaign in the swing state of Wisconsin, I said to her I believed she would be one of our nation's greatest First Ladies. Reading BECOMING I find indeed she is. May such integrity and commitment to our nation's common good once again flourish in our nation's Capitol and White House.

  Michelle O’Bama spoke like we were sitting at the kitchen table over a cup of coffee.  I felt she was a friend sharing her worries, her hopes and dreams.  She wasn’t shy about sharing her weaknesses.  She made herself vulnerable without making her reader  feel guilty.  A lovely read from a lovely lady.  Proud to have called her “our First Lady.”

  Really loved this book, I didn't want it to end! It's separated into three parts: childhood, courtship with Barack , and the White House (the section I was most looking forward to). I absolutely loved the first two parts of the book, but the last bit was anti-climactic for me. Her philanthropic initiatives as FLOTUS, while heart-warming and interesting, started feeling too repetitive after a while.

  Great for insights into how a campaign works, and how Michelle managed motherhood and career (and how she and her husband made adjustments and worked together as a team).

  Fantastic! Very interesting early childhood of persistence and achievements towards goals.A wonderful peak at the workings of the White House with growing children. The loving achievements  of Michele and Barack shine through. The moral character, civility and respect for one another, each other and the nation are in stark contrast to what is happening in the White House today.

  Incredibly thought provoking, inside glimpse to a life in politics and an individual thrust into the limelight. As a new mom it gave me the freedom to advocate for myself, to carve out time for my career and selfcare, all while focusing on the bigger issues of family, kindness, friendship, and faith.

  Mrs. Obama--Michelle--shared her unvarnished story.  The book left me churning with ideas and plans to harness my skills, sharpen my abilities, and continue becoming me by living, as Michelle, a life of service despite being--or maybe especially because I am--a middle aged, black, female, immigrant who has felt the painful sting of racism and marginalization, but remains hopeful that our  better nature would prevail.

  Really enjoyed reading this memoir by the former First Lady. I was a fan of hers before reading the book, but I am an even bigger fan now. It was moving, funny, and strangely soothing to read about her time as First Lady. I think it was refreshing to remember a timewhen she was in office and served as a role model.
