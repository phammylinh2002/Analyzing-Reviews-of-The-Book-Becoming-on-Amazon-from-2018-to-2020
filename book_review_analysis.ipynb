    "\n",
    "This small project aims to help me get back on track with data analytics while evaluating whether **Becoming** by **Michelle Obama** is worth reading. I’ve come across this book in many bookstores and have heard positive reviews, but I’m still unsure if it’s suitable for me at this time. By analyzing readers' reviews, we can gain insights into what people think about the book and decide whether to purchase it now or at a later stage in my life.\n",
